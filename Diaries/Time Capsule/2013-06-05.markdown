Dear past-me:

Before we get into the meat of it, just a heads-up: you are mistaken about discipline. Discipline is a patch rather than a mend. Instead of cultivating discipline you should attempt to align your desires with your goals - if this is attained there is no need for discipline.

Here are some important things you should know about life:

- **read lots and lots of non-fiction**. Nobody else reads non-fiction, and this will give you an advantage.
- **don't pretend to be someone you're not**. You think this is a skill you have down, but surprise: you're wrong. You constantly hide the rough edges of your personality, or the less-than-cool parts of yourself. My friend, you should be embracing these facets of yourself, because they're the parts that make you interesting. Also, you will be *much* happier when you internalize this advice.
- **anki is fantastic**. Since you, I've seemingly successfully installed an anki habit by convicing my emotional brain it's a good idea. This is an implementation of my original point about discipline - align your desires with your goals. 
- **beeminder is a great utility**. Beeminder is letting you get 2x done a week. 200%! Fuck yeah. The general principle here is that even if tools are hard to use, a lot of the time their results will be worth the learning curve.

The most important thing I've learned recently is that emotional connections are not something to be feared. They're kind of incredible. Seriously. Honestly. What's even better is that they're super easy to cultivate if you put yourself on the line. Fuck being aloof.

You've got your heart and your head in the right place, man. Try to think about the deeper implications of your ideas, and make sure you run them through a sanity filter beforehand. 

Sincerely,
Sandy

Hi future-me!

I hope you are well, and are reading this in disgust of how naive and poorly thought out it is. That's not to say I think it's bad, but simply that you're a lot smarter than I am. This is the never-ending goal, so don't let me down.

The most important skills to be working right now on are effective time management and constant discomfort. Effective time management means you're going to accomplish a lot more of your goals in the same amount of time (awesome!), and constant discomfort means you're going to always be expanding your comfort zones (leading to more opportunities, leading to more awesome!).

I fully expect the following of you:

- **live your life by beeminder**. Seriously. All of it. Beemind relaxation time, hours of work, personal goals, social expectations, meta-time, reading, everything. This will automate life, meaning you odn't need to spend any mental effort on accomplishing things to which you have precommitted. The meta-time will allow for systematic improvement of this system.
- **reinstall GTD habits**. This is more effective time management.
- **do CoZE for the thrill**. Doing new things is cool. It really is, even if it's scary as hell. Aligning our goals and desires such that we want to do CoZE will pay off exponentially.

Until I learn more things, those are my current goals.

My pomodoro is almost over, so I'm going to leave you here. I hope you're well, and until next time:

"Up by the bootstraps, young man!"
