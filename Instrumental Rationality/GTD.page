## Overview

Out of all resources, attention is the most important. Even small annoyances can cascade into big problems. This decreases stress, increases functional conscientiousness (correlated with academic and business success, as well as being trainable), and likely makes you achieve long term goals.

## Disclaimer

This is likely not the best solution for you. This is what works for me, and the point is to be good enough to build incrementally. Must be stable at the meta level.

    TODO(sandy): elaborate

It will require a long process of iteration to optimize, but it will most likely be worth it.

## Concept

GTD splits getting things done into three categories:

Overview:
Assemble work into collection bins
Define work into a reminder system
Do work

It relies on the principle of "Don't trust your brain for things your brain is not trustworthy for."


## Collecting work

Anything that comes into your world needs to be collected and needs to be in a recallable form. Apply this everywhere. Timestamp any ideas you can't explicitly write down. Add as many inboxes as necessary. Every situation should have an inbox corresponding to it, but have as few as you can get away with.

When to have inboxes?
