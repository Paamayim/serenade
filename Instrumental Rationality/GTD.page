## Overview

Of all cognitive resources, attention is by far the most important. Without it, we lose goal-orientation, th ability to do precise work, and task focusedness. The number of things in modern life which require our attention is astonishingly huge, and even the miniscule task of keeping track of to whom you owe correspondence is eating away at attention that you could otherwise be using more effectively.

GTD (short for Getting Things Done, but not to be confused with [Getting Things Done]()), is a system which keeps track of things for you, and helps ensure their completion. GTD is the synergy of several productivity tools, all being strategically leveraged towards a common goal. 

## Disclaimer

The following document describes my GTD workflow. Since everyone's brain works differently, I can safely guarantee you that this will *not be the optimal productivity tool for you*. As a matter of fact, I can safely guarantee that this is not the optimal productivity tool for *me*. However, with that being said, not being optimal is hardly equatable with being useless, and you will likely notice instantaneous results with even this system.

Like with all of life, the secret to GTD is to experiment frequently. Always be on the lookout for processes which could be more streamlined, or simply for aspects of the system which simply don't work for you. Awareness is the first step to improvement. 

The goal of this document is to provide a GTD system which is good enough to be instrumental in improving itself incrementally. Changing the way you do things every couple of days is *absolutely fine*, so long as the process is stable at the metalevel. Guaranteeing metasuccess in turn will guarantee objective success.

## Concept

GTD splits getting things done into three categories:

Overview:
Assemble work into collection bins
Define work into a reminder system
Do work

It relies on the principle of "Don't trust your brain for things your brain is not trustworthy for."


## Collecting work

Anything that comes into your world needs to be collected and needs to be in a recallable form. Apply this everywhere. Timestamp any ideas you can't explicitly write down. Add as many inboxes as necessary. Every situation should have an inbox corresponding to it, but have as few as you can get away with.

When to have inboxes?
