    TODO(sandy): split this document out into abstract and quickstarter implementation

## Overview

Of all cognitive resources, attention is by far the most important. Without it, we lose goal-orientation, th ability to do precise work, and task focusedness. The number of things in modern life which require our attention is astonishingly huge, and even the miniscule task of keeping track of to whom you owe correspondence is eating away at attention that you could otherwise be using more effectively.

GTD (short for Getting Things Done, but not to be confused with [Getting Things Done]()), is a system which keeps track of things for you, and helps ensure their completion. GTD is the synergy of several productivity tools, all being strategically leveraged towards a common goal. 

## Disclaimer

The following document describes my GTD workflow. Since everyone's brain works differently, I can safely guarantee you that this will *not be the optimal productivity tool for you*. As a matter of fact, I can safely guarantee that this is not the optimal productivity tool for *me*.[^1] However, with that being said, not being optimal is hardly equatable with being useless, and you will likely notice instantaneous results with even this system. Like with all of life, the secret to GTD is to experiment frequently. Always be on the lookout for processes which could be more streamlined, or simply for aspects of the system which simply don't work for you. Awareness is the first step to improvement. 

The goal of this document is to provide a GTD system which is good enough to be instrumental in improving itself incrementally. Changing the way you do things every couple of days is *absolutely fine*, so long as the process is stable at the metalevel. Guaranteeing metasuccess in turn will guarantee objective success.

[^1]: In the month it has taken me to write this sequence, I have iterated over the design three or four times. It's a constant optimization battle against myself, and it feels *great*.

## Concept

GTD marks the workflow of a task lifetime into three distinct phases: **collecting work**, **defining work** and **doing work**. Each is equally vital to the success of the project, though for very different reasons. Each phase will be discussed here.

**Collecting work** is the process of scribbling down ideas that occur to you and storing them in *inboxes*. You are probably already familiar with the concept of an inbox, like in your email, it is simply a location for new tasks to accumulate until you get around to processing them. Whenever a task that needs attending to is jogged in your memory, the thought should be recorded in an inbox somewhere. Collecting work is the generalized equivalent of the thought "gee, this man has nice teeth. Oh, that reminds me! I *really need* to get around to making that dentist's appointment".

The next step of the process, **defining work** is concerned with emptying out your inboxes, figuring out exactly what accomplishing the task consists of, recording this in your *reminder system*, and delegating the first step to a future version of yourself. Defining work is roughly the generalized equivalent of a writer taking a bunch of story elements and conceptualizing the main plot points of a novel.

Finally **doing work** consists of respecting past-you's delegations, actually working on tasks, and backtracking to the previous steps if necessary. But more on that later.

While at first glance this sounds like a lot of unnecessary micromanagement of an already too-busy lifestyle, please suspend your disbelief for a little while longer and keep reading. It turns out that adding these extra little complications will amazingly simplify other aspects of your routine. The benefits far outweigh the additional overhead, trust me on this one.

## Collecting work

    TODO(sandy): from here on out the article is unfinished

Anything that comes into your world needs to be collected and needs to be in a recallable form. Apply this everywhere. Timestamp any ideas you can't explicitly write down. Add as many inboxes as necessary. Every situation should have an inbox corresponding to it, but have as few as you can get away with.
