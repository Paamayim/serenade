Disclaimer about uniqueness

Out of all resources, attention is the most important. Even small annoyances can cascade into big problems. This decreases stress, increases functional conscientiousness (correlated with academic and business success, as well as being trainable), and likely makes you achieve long term goals.

Don't trust your brain for things your brain is not trustworthy for.

Important part is to have a system that is good enough so that you can iterate over it and build it incrementally. It must be stable at the metalevel.


Collecting work

Anything that comes into your world needs to be collected and needs to be in a recallable form. Apply this everywhere. Timestamp any ideas you can't explicitly write down. Add as many inboxes as necessary. Every situation should have an inbox corresponding to it, but have as few as you can get away with.
