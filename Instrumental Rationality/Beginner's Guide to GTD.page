## Beginner's Guide

This document will walk you through the steps of bootstrapping your very own [GTD]() system. Before you begin, you should be familiar with what we are trying to accomplish, which is available in the [GTD FAQ]().

## Remember The Milk

Remember The Milk is our main inbox and reminder system.

### Preparation

Sign up for a free account at [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/Registration.action). Don't do anything here yet.

Sign up for a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar&service=cl) (where we will get our calendar from), if you don't have one already. Don't do anything here either.

Sign up for a free account at [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/signup/). 

Click on **Settings** in the top right corner.

Under the **General** tab (where you should be already), check the **Show Task Cloud on the Tasks screen** box. Click **Save Changes**.

Move to the **Lists** tab. Select the **All Tasks, Personal, Study, Work** lists, and under the **More Actions...** dropdown, select **Delete List**. You should be left with only two lists now. Click the **Add List** button, type *M*, and hit *ENTER* on your keyboard. *M* is where we will define our work.

Click on the Remember The Milk cow logo. This should return you to the task list. Press the following keys:
    i <DEL>

It should now say **You have no incomplete tasks in this list. Woohoo!**. Woohoo indeed!

### Brain Dump

Click on the **Add a new task** bar. Now it is time to clear your brain of everything you are trying to remember, and use Remember The Milk to do it for you instead.

Type out a quick memo to yourself about something that is on your mind that needs to be done, then press enter. Examples of this might be *feed the cat*, *take out the garbage*, *get my tires changed*, *write Grandma*, *redecorate my room*, *read 1984*, etc. Continue doing this until you can't come up with any more tasks that need to be done. 

Physically walk around your house, noting things which would be nice to have done. Examples: *clean the mirrors*, *replace that lightbulb*, *sweep*, *do laundry*, *figure out why the radiator doesn't emit very much heat*, etc. Enter these into Remember The Milk.

Hopefully by this point you have more than a screen's worth of memos to yourself. Now think about long term goals you have, or projects that you've been meaning to do for years. Put THESE too into Remember The Milk. Examples: *travel to Russia*, *write a novel*, *learn Korean*, *learn to play an instrument*, *read more Keats*, *find someone worth marrying*, *enjoy a beer on the top of Mount Everest*, *save the world*, etc. Write down absolutely everything you can think of, even if it sounds stupid or impossible. Don't be afraid to jot things down - it's better to get them out of your mind than to keep them swaddled up in there.

Do a mental sweep and see if any of the following topics jog your memory: *commitments to friends/family/associates/subordinates/customers/society*, *communications to make (emails, faxes, phone calls)*, *things that need to be scheduled*, *things you need to ask other people for*, *financial concerns (bills, budgeting, taxes, mortgages)*, *information/objects you're waiting for*, *upcoming events (birthdays, weddings, vacations, social events)*, *health care (doctors, dentists, optometrists)*, and finally *hobbies*. Write down everything that came up.

Is your list intimidatingly long? If so, great! If not, think of more things, you slacker.

### Defining Work

Now it's time to figure out how to accomplish each item in our to-do list.

Press the *ESCAPE* key on your keyboard. This should deselect the *Add a new task* bar.

Press the *I*, and then the "T" keys on your keyboard. The first item in your to-do list should be selected, and you should be back in the *Add a new task bar* (this is intentional). Type out the very first non-trivial action you would need to do to accomplish this goal, but don't hit enter yet. For example, if my task were "get my tires changed", I might write "find a mechanic who deals with tires". If my task were "read 1984", I might write "buy a copy of 1984". If my task were "learn to play an instrument", I might write "determine which instrument to learn to play". You get the idea.

Before pressing enter, we need to associate some metadata with this task. Type **#M** at the end of your task (this tells Remember The Milk to put this task in our reminder system, not the inbox). Don't press enter yet.

Determine whether the task:

- ABSOLUTELY MUST be finished by a certain date: append **^when it must be done by**. Examples: *^tomorrow*, *^sept 11*, *^three weeks from now*.
- is a subtask of a larger project: append **#projects**
- fits conveniently into a category (things like *correspondence*, *scheduling*, *homework*, *long term projects*, *errands*, etc): append **#category** (make sure to fill in the category with the one you selected)

Make sure your task fits into one of these three options. If not, consider making a **#misc** category, then immediately creating the task: "**sort out misc category #M #meta**" if you haven't already.

Hit the following keys on your keyboard: *ENTER*, *ESCAPE*, *DELETE*, *i*, *t*. The task you just completed should be deleted from the list, and you should have the next one selected.

Repeat this section until your inbox is empty.

*Pro tip: if your inbox is far too large to complete in one go, consider selecting all of the remaining tasks, assigning them the tag **#gtd** on the right side of the screen, moving them to the **M** list in the **More Actions** drop down list, then adding the following task "**finish defining work for the gtd tag #M #meta**"*.

Add the following tasks:

- "convert projects into evernotes #M #meta"
- "schedule timeblocks for contexts #M #meta"
- "schedule a meta timeblock #M #meta"

## Google Calendar

Make calendars for scheduled time, social events, GTD. Color them differently.

Don't forget travel time!

### Getting (Meta) Things Done

Schedule an hour per week for meta.

Schedule at least an hour per week for each context in RTM.

Schedule a time for projects.

## Evernote

Move all projects into evernote.
