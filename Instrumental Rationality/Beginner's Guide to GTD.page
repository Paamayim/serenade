## Beginner's Guide

This document will walk you through the steps of bootstrapping your very own [GTD]() system. Before you begin, you should be familiar with what we are trying to accomplish, which is available in the [GTD FAQ]().

## Remember The Milk

Remember The Milk is our main inbox and reminder system.

### Preparation

Sign up for a free account at [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/signup/). 

Click on **Settings** in the top right corner.

Under the **General** tab (where you should be already), check the **Show Task Cloud on the Tasks screen** box. Click **Save Changes**.

Move to the **Lists** tab. Select the **All Tasks, Personal, Study, Work** lists, and under the **More Actions...** dropdown, select **Delete List**. You should be left with only two lists now. Click the **Add List** button, type *M*, and hit *ENTER* on your keyboard. *M* is where we will define our work.

Click on the Remember The Milk cow logo. This should return you to the task list. Press the following keys:
    i <DEL>

It should now say **You have no incomplete tasks in this list. Woohoo!**. Woohoo indeed!

### Brain Dump

Click on the **Add a new task** bar. Now it is time to clear your brain of everything you are trying to remember, and use Remember The Milk to do it for you instead.

Type out a quick memo to yourself about something that is on your mind that needs to be done, then press enter. Examples of this might be *feed the cat*, *take out the garbage*, *get my tires changed*, *write Grandma*, *redecorate my room*, *read 1984*, etc. Continue doing this until you can't come up with any more tasks that need to be done. 

Physically walk around your house, noting things which would be nice to have done. Examples: *clean the mirrors*, *replace that lightbulb*, *sweep*, *do laundry*, *figure out why the radiator doesn't emit very much heat*, etc. Enter these into Remember The Milk.

Hopefully by this point you have more than a screen's worth of memos to yourself. Now think about long term goals you have, or projects that you've been meaning to do for years. Put THESE too into Remember The Milk. Examples: *travel to Russia*, *write a novel*, *learn Korean*, *learn to play an instrument*, *read more Keats*, *find someone worth marrying*, *enjoy a beer on the top of Mount Everest*, *save the world*, etc. Write down absolutely everything you can think of, even if it sounds stupid or impossible. Don't be afraid to jot things down - it's better to get them out of your mind than to keep them swaddled up in there.

Do a mental sweep and see if any of the following topics jog your memory: *commitments to friends/family/associates/subordinates/customers/society*, *communications to make (emails, faxes, phone calls)*, *things that need to be scheduled*, *things you need to ask other people for*, *financial concerns (bills, budgeting, taxes, mortgages)*, *information/objects you're waiting for*, *upcoming events (birthdays, weddings, vacations, social events)*, *health care (doctors, dentists, optometrists)*, and finally *hobbies*. Write down everything that came up.
