## The World

The world as we know it does not exist. Instead, the world is shaped like a bottle, with the inside a spanning ocean around the sides of the bottle. The inner topology is thus a torus (as a result, one can float indefinitely with no guarantee of arriving anywhere), with the mouth and foot of the bottle being special. At the mouth of the bottle exists the end of the world, a neverending waterfall into the abyss [^1]. At the foot exists the only landmass in the world.

For as long as recorded history, the world has been flooded, with tens of generations having been born, raised, and died aboard a ship - living the only life they'd ever known. This implies that ships are a valuable commodity, as they are the essence of life and non-renewable. Boats moor to one another to form ad-hoc cities. As such, the civilization is extremely fluid and behaves very organically with little hierarchy. Civilizations form, merge, and split as rapidly as life can be lived, spreading culture and ideologies around. Often, a floatila will reach an ideological standoff, and the two groups will split from one another. This leads to strongly reinforced group-think and cultlike dynamics.

A city has very little governance per se, but authority is gained through seniority, which itself is gained through permanence. The most influential people tend to be those clustered in the middle of the floatila, as they provide a stable anchoring point against which those seeking to join the community must agree with. As a signalled manifestation of this permanence, those of high rank are *physically unable* to split from the city, as they are blockaded in.

The currents will move a city as they will. With no landmass it is unnecessary to have a permanent location, as the sea provides only relative reference points.

Ships are strongly entwined in the culture of the seafolk. Since they are irreplaceable, those causing even the tiniest of damage to a vessel are highly scorned - much to the extent that book burning is in our own culture. Wars, while not being fought often, though not unheard of, are thus very different than our concept of combat. No direct ship to ship battle may occur, for fear of destroying the only places to live. There are no scruples about killing other humans, simply that it must be done cautiously.

Of course, sinking ships is a significantly easier means of deciding combat. Small bands of highly ideologically exiles (think terrorists, pirates or cultists) have no qualms with this means of action, and as such are extremely feared. Stories of the bogeyman are instead about these pirates. The situation is very reminiscient of the cold war, in that there are frequent hunts for pirate spies, and that they are a threat to "our way of life". In fact, they are a threat to life itself.

The ocean is full of megafauna - huge aquatic beasts. For the most part, they leave humans to their own devices (after all, the sea is large and very deep), but one in particular does not. It is a giant whale, with skin not dissimilar to stained glass. The pirates worship this beast; they imagine it to be a god of some sort. There exists an ancient device said to be able to summon the whale, and the pirates want nothing less than to get their hands on it. It would be both the apex religious symbol, and the ultimate weapon. The device allows one to convene with the whale, and suggest courses of action to it. 

Only one man alive knows the secret to creating this convening device - an old, and possibly insane, hermit. He is a self described sage and the last of a legacy of the memory-guild: a group whose sole purpose was to record all of history in their minds.  Once upon a time, such men were thought highly of and the counsel was greatly seeked. However, their self-imposed ascetic lifestyle was not enticing, and the number of those who pledged their servitude to history dwindled more and more. During the age of the great empires, admirals would be so displeased when battle plans failed that they would have their scholars beheaded (as they were master strategians - although nobody is always right).
