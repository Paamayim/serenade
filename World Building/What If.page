- the universe were directly programmable
    - in a purely functional language?
- quantum suicide were viable
- we directly experienced reality without going through our brains
- we directly experienced thoughts
- **meta-levels could be elevated to object-levels**
- time went 1000x faster (or slower?)
- correct proofs were harmonious or otherwise evidently correct
- human interaction were entirely formalized
- fractals could be designed and grown organically
- time could be rewound at the cost of doubling your aging
- **reality were a fundamental particle**
    - removing it could cause results inconsistent with the rest of the universe
    - removing too much would cause irrepairable corruption. gangrene of timespace.
    - **adding it to a hypercomputer could reprogram reality**
