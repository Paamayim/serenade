An arch-nemesis seems like a wonderful way of motivating myself. It's romantic - and thus powerfully symbolic - and personalized. Brian suggests externalizing a portion of my mind that I dislike as this villain.

My first reaction to this thought was that my own mind wouldn't be a worthy enough opponent. Further thought on this point oscillates and is unable to come to a conclusion. On one hand, the villain should be smarter than I am, to ensure there is a challenge. On the other, surely my brain would be able to give itself a run for its money, and doing so would create a very strong feedback loop.

I've intentionally attempted to shatter my mind before, not in any self-injuring sense, but more out of curiosity. Everything I've seriously attempted to best in my life I've successfully beaten [^1], and most are not very challenging. Naturally this can lead to boredom, and so I turned to attempting to best myself. I spent several months attempting to induce schizophrenia, simply to see if I could handle it. Successfully overcoming my own misfunctioning mental faculties *by sheer intellect and willpower alone* would be the ultimate achievement.

[^1]: This is not actually true, but it is an overwhelming useful misconception.

Thus fracturing my mind into a supervillain is quite intruiging. I'm going to give it a try. This part of my mind will be intentionally and extremely personified in an attempt to convince my emotional mind that he is really *real*.

It comes to my attention that more than half of the decorations in my room are skeletons. In fact, I realize my self-imposed nickname came from a skeleton. As a symbol, the skeleton represents death, the past, evil, and misguidance, among other things. I am particularly fond of skeletons, and this seems like a suitable alter ego, especially since rationalist me loves life, looks towards the future, and intends to do as much good as possible. In lieu of a better name, he shall be Winter - a name I've intermittently considered calling myself. It seems appropriate: cold, unyielding, killing, evasive yet ever present.

So shall it be. Winter, a balding, skeletal man aged twenty years older than he has. A man with a taste for perverse humor, melancholy, violence, A man who would uneducate the people so that he alone could sit atop the cerebral throne, satisfied that none can oppose him. A man who hasn't become this way by choice, but rather through inaction and a tendency of not staying true to his values. A man who once wanted to be a hero, but found this to be the easier path. 

I imagine the relationship like that between Sherlocke and Moriarty.
