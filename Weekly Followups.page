    TODO(sandy): turn this into prose so it makes sense

## Week 1

use priority for things that NEED to get done  
3 -> urgent  
2 -> urgent important  
1 -> do or die  

dont attempt to force yourself to always been in the right mood  
always respect messages from past me  
only send important messages to future me  
have a time block of daily routine  
super important things: clearing inbox, doing do list  
timeblock a due period, attempt to empty the due list <------  
timeblock projects over individual activities  
analytics on goal factoring  

-------------

gtd about non rationality stuff  
goal related goal factoring  
think about moving workspaces  
find low hanging fruit first  
turbocharging > rewarding yourself on timescale of a second > installing habits   
happy gesture has to be genuine,   
    or focusing on the actual small successes and going "hey look at that"  
offline training visualize facebook as a bomb   
    sometimes actually explode yourself  

offline training helps noticing behaviors to avoid or reinforce  
turbocharging is more the framework to improve (forefront of intensity without making mistakes)  

planning kata will probably improve as GTD is better bootstrapped  
    take a next action and ask what could go wrong  
    also any project in GTD  
- think about specific things im doing today or in the next week, rather than on specific environmental problems

2 weeks of hell  
after a month you start feeling back to normal  
everyman takes 2 months before being normal  


## Week 2

michael vassar: "people don't do anything. people run on habits they already have"  
follow ups might help  
uberman is unhealthy  
low hanging fruit finding: is what i'm doing the most important? is this the best way to do it (wrt opportunity costs)?  
    INSTALL A HABIT TO DO THIS  
    is this the most influential part of the thing i care about?  
        look for the most important factors to focus on. don't optimize for everything. the most impactful  
        look for dominant behaviors  
        is it worthwhile to look at higher order less influential things?  
    look at behaviors as taylor polynomial approximation  
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle  

get things done preferably done  
    look at when something MUST be done, schedule a super important issue  
    have a big red deadline calendar  
    look at sending GTD messages rather than calendar messages  
        "Is today a good day to do the thing? #main ^due_date"  
        "you must do the thing today! #main ^due_date !1"  
        why did i mispredict if now isn't a good time  
        ask why predictions did work  
    look for opportunities to do tag queues  

keep gmail inbox empty  
    on email, what do i want to do with it?  
        can i delete it? does it require action? otherwise must be archived  
        if it requires action, star it  
        create a GTD with the url, then archive this from the inbox  

filing systems:  
    searching makes filing somewhat unnecessary  
    evernote might be useful  
    anki decks  

set labels on timeblocks to do pomodoros  

think about making technical metas LONGER

think about doing more goal refactoring explicitly

overall life strategy meta block
    use google tasks to remember things, check them in metablock
    
goal factor on opensource vs personal issues

set up a private facing serenade for meditations

goal: submit something to LW
    search before posting - spend a pomodoro  5, 10 minutes
    
think about maintaining enthusiasm about rationality

do offline training about getting out of bed

get a WHOLE BUNCH OF ALARMS
