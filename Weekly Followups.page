## Week 1

    TODO(sandy): turn this into prose so it makes sense

use priority for things that NEED to get done
3 -> urgent
2 -> urgent important
1 -> do or die

dont attempt to force yourself to always been in the right mood
always respect messages from past me
only send important messages to future me
have a time block of daily routine
super important things: clearing inbox, doing do list
timeblock a due period, attempt to empty the due list <------
timeblock projects over individual activities
analytics on goal factoring

-------------

gtd about non rationality stuff
goal related goal factoring
think about moving workspaces
find low hanging fruit first
turbocharging > rewarding yourself on timescale of a second > installing habits 
happy gesture has to be genuine, 
    or focusing on the actual small successes and going "hey look at that"
offline training visualize facebook as a bomb 
    sometimes actually explode yourself

offline training helps noticing behaviors to avoid or reinforce
turbocharging is more the framework to improve (forefront of intensity without making mistakes)

planning kata will probably improve as GTD is better bootstrapped
    take a next action and ask what could go wrong
    also any project in GTD
- think about specific things im doing today or in the next week, rather than on specific environmental problems
