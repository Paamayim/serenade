# Manifesto of the Superhero

If I were a superhero, I would:

- Dedicate time every day to self improvement.
- Inspire others to become superheroes also.
- Know what my goals are, and have a plan about how to accomplish them.
- Keep my emotional desires in tune with my long-term plans.
- Be bound by my promises.
- Regularly encounter and defeat challenges.
- Let my actions speak more loudly than my words.
- Maximize my efficiency to get more things done with the same amount of time.
- Freely share all of my knowledge with anyone who seeks it.
- Minimize fleeting distractions.
- Help anyone who asks, and anyone who doesn't ask but wishes they could.
- Try something new every day.
- Be distateful (rather than fearful) of failure.
- Realize everyone has something to teach me, though some have significantly more than others.
- Regularly set time aside to consider if I'm being the person I want to be (maybe I don't want to be a superhero?).
- Freely volunteer my services to causes in which I believe.
- Stay motivated.
- Be aware that perfection is the enemy of progress.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, not one item on this list is terribly difficult in isolation. It is my opinion that being a superhero is not only possible but, in fact, easy. 

Ever since I was a boy, I have aspired to superherodom, and thus I hereby openly state my intention to do each and every point on this list. While it's not exactly what I imagined I wanted to be as a child, it's certainly what I imagine I want to be as an adult.

Sincerely,  
Sandy Maguire
