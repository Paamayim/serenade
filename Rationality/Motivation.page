# Foreword

Hi there! You probably are reading this guide because you, like most people, have issues getting motivated about things that you know are important. This presents a unique challenge to the author of any how-to guide on motivation, and that's "how can I make sure my readers are motivated enough to read all the way through the guide?". I'm not entirely sure what the answer to that problem is, but I have a few ideas that can help. The first is to pre-commit to reading all of the way through this guide - remember, it might not help you even if you read all the way through, but it /definitely/ won't help if you don't read any of it. The other piece of advice I can offer is, if you are having any problems whatsoever getting through it, consider writing me a short email (sandy.g.maguire@gmail.com). I promise to respond as soon as I can, and you never know, I might just be able to help. So with that in mind, let's get started, shall we?


Getting Motivated: A Guide to Learning How to Accomplish Anything
=================================================================

# Introduction

> "A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it." - Kay, Men in Black

Humans are spectacularly ill-equipt for living in the modern world. We've spent millions [fact check this] of years getting good at gathering berries, avoiding being eaten by lions, and living in small tribes of no more than 50 others [fact check this too]. Spend a few seconds thinking about the last time you needed to worry about not being eaten by a lion, scavenging your own food, or seeing fewer than 50 people in even /one day/. Society evolves much faster than homo sapiens can, and as a result, as a species we are simply /bad at life/. Don't get me wrong - we're good at living - but we're not good at recognizing important tasks in our lives and doing things about them. What's even worse is that our lion-avoiding instincts will kick in at the worst possible times - when we're talking to someone influential, learning a new skill, or changing careers. These examples are all /potential problems/, and our ancestral brains only know about one kind of problem. So instead of rising to the occassion and conquering our fears, the little voice inside our heads tells us to start running and never look back. It tells us that modern day lions will eat us, and being eaten is a Bad Thing(TM).

Of course, this is exactly as ridiculous as it sounds. The negative outcomes of modern day problems never being eaten. For the most part, they're inside our heads: "I'm not good at math - I'm useless", "I must of sounded like a fool in front of the boss today - what must he think of me?", "moving to China for a new job is scary; I'd better just stay here where it's safe and comfortable". [something about being scared]

[I need a metaphor here. Owning things vs creating things]

A common cause of this point of view is that our selves are constant and persistant. It's viewing the world through a lens of possession of [metaphor above]. "The reason I'm not good at math is because I wasn't born with any mathematical talents." is a very different thought than "The reason I'm not good at math is because none of my teachers were able to relate it to me in a way that I understood". The first scenario is a perfect example of what's known as a **fixed mindset** - I am as I am and regardless of what happens, I'm going to be like this forever. It's easy to see why this point of view is common - it absolves us of our failures and shortcomings. It's not my fault that I'm bad at [such-and-such], I was born this way.

The other way of looking at the world is the **growth mindset**, which is the idea that our shortcomings are simply problems that we *haven't gotten around to fixing yet*. It is hard to overstate the importance of such a thought. By looking at personal flaws as problems which are only temporarily problems, we are awarded with the ability to do something about it. We are given the opportunity to grow as people, to achieve possibilities so far beyond our current reach that it seems impossible we'll ever get there. But just because something we want is out of grasp doesn't mean we should stop trying to get it. This affords us the chance to get creative and come up with smarter ways of doing what we're doing, because it might just work.

The only guaranteed route to failure is to simply not try.

If you feel like the fixed mindset described above is an accurate (if a little harsh) depiction of the way you see yourself, then this book is especially for you. I'm not asking you to give up your mental image of yourself or to pretend to be someone you're not. All I'm asking is that you suspend your disbelief that more is possible. I really, honestly and truly believe that absolutely every single person is capable of their wildest dreams if they just intelligently start working towards them.

So what are you waiting for? Your goals aren't going to accomplish themselves.


## A note on how to apply this book

The first chapter of this book discusses a lot of theory about motivation - the whys behind the hows of what we're going to be doing in Chapter 2. I know that theory can be dry and boring, and while I'll do my best to avoid that, this information really is useful. I would wholeheartedly recommend reading through the entirety of it, but if you find your motivation to read this book slipping, feel free to skip the remainder of it. It's more important that you develop the habits of motivation than know why it works, but I suspect you will have more luck with a theoretical spine to (forgive the pun), back it all up.




# The Science of Motivation

> "The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting. That's pride fucking with you. Fuck pride. Pride only hurts, it never helps." - Marsellus Wallace, Pulp Fiction

Procrastination is the lack of motivation, which implies we should be able to learn about motivation by observing components of procrastination. In my experience, procrastination is caused by one of two causes: **the Profession/Anticipation Divide** or the presence of an **Ugh Field**.


## The Profession/Anticipation Divide

Have you ever experienced a wave of fear while peering over the railing in an atrium, or while watching a scary movie? Despite the knowledge that you're perfectly safe, you somehow still experience fear. You might have wondered where this dichotomy comes from, and you might be surprised that the same principle is at work when you are experience procrastination. This dissonant feeling between knowing you are safe and feeling like you are not is known as the Profession/Anticipation divide, or, if you are familiar with the terminology, beliefs and aliefs. 

Professions, or beliefs, are pieces of *explicit* knowledge or thoughts about the world which you might harbor. You consciously know that it would take an extraordinary amount of effort for you to somehow make it over the railing of the atrium and fall to your death. If someone were to ask you when you weren't immediately in the situation, you would tell them as much.

Anticipations, or aliefs, however, are the *intrinsic* models of the world you keep in your mind. They are often instinctual, and are what your subconscious expects to happen. While your conscious knows that you are perfectly safe, your subconscious has evolved over many millenia to *not be close to any great heights*. Your reptile brain *expects* that being close to the ledge means you will fall off. It expects that you can trust the senses feeding you images of scary movies. 

I would expect that if you spent a few minutes thinking about it, the majority of the things you procrastinate have conflicting professions and anticipations. You might profess that writing that work report is important, but anticipate it having very little effect on your life. You might profess that you want to learn that new sport, but anticipate that you will be so bad that people will laugh at you. Aligning your professions and anticipations is the first step towards being getting things done.

**What to take away:** Your brain believes things that you do not. Don't worry when you start 


## Ugh-fields

[make this better - start with the fence analogy]
[describe as a mental flinch]

An ugh field is the barrier that your mind puts around topics which it finds stressful to think about. It's an example of Pavlovian conditioning - if you punish your consciousness for thinking about an idea, you're not providing much incentive for it to continue thinking about it. Think about an electric fence, you're going to learn in a hurry that you shouldn't touch it. The same concept applies when we think about topics we don't like - it's easier and less painful to simply not think about them.

Try thinking about activities you don't do because you've never been good at them. These are examples of weak ugh fields, but ugh fields are in general quite nefarious. By definition, they're the ideas that your mind won't tell you when you ask "what kind of things don't I think about?". 

While it's beyond the scope of this book to dive in-depth to ugh fields, it's a good idea to keep an eye out for them. Try to notice when your mind flinches away from a thought, and make a note of it for later analysis. 

Be careful when dealing with ugh fields, because they have a nasty habit of growing. Any topic you associate with an ugh field is at risk for sliding into the field itself. As such, it's exceptionally important to **never** scold yourself when you make an honest mistake. Getting better at things means making mistakes and learning from experience, but if you're afraid of making mistakes it's easy to stop trying to get better at things. Remember, we're not trying to avoid mistakes, we're trying to make fewer of them. I find it's helpful to be grateful about noticing a mistake because it gives you an opportunity to reflect on what went wrong, and come up with a way to learn from it.

**What to take away:** Don't beat yourself up about making mistakes. They're natural, and you're going to be better off if you welcome your mistakes than if you shoo them away.


## Perfection: The Enemy of the Good

Closely related to this idea is the anti-thought pattern that things must be perfect. I know too many people who are happy with nothing less than perfection. I would say that this is a noble goal, except that it really, really isn't. Nothing you do is ever going to *perfect*, but everything has the potential to be *good enough*. If you only ever strive to be perfect, your fear of making mistakes will prevent you from being good.

**What to take away:** Nothing will ever be perfect. Don't expect it to be. Determine what you consider to be good enough, and strive for that instead.


## The Motivation Equation

Now that we have explored a little into the realm of procrastination, it's time to take a dive into the opposite side of the equation: motivation. As it turns out, a lot of smart people have been thinking about motivation [some history?] and have, in fact, come up with an equation for it:

${Motivation} = \frac{{Value}*{Expectancy}}{{Impulsiveness}*{Delay}}$

If you are not mathematically inclined, in short this says that motivation is the product of four separate components. The two positive aspects of motivation are **value**, how worthwhile something is, and **expectancy**, how likely it is that the rewards can be reaped. On the flip side of the coin, factors which will decrease your motivation are **impulsiveness**, how hard it is to stay on track, and **delay**, how long it will take until you can see the benefits of your hard work.

In order to become more motivated for something, you need to increase its **value** or **expectancy**, or decrease its **impulsiveness** or **delay**. Different approaches will work for different problems, and often many approaches will work for a given problem. We will explore techniques later on for how to change these variables, but in the meantime it's good enough to simply be familiar with them.


### Protip: Use Pomodoros

If you take anything at all away from this book, it should be the following: use pomodoros. The pomodoro technique [insert history], simply put, is a wonderful productivity tool. What's better is that it's very easy to implement. Simply decide what to work on, grab an egg timer, set it for 25 minutes, then get to work. Seriously, that's it. That's all you need to do to become more productive. There's a catch, but it's a very small one. You must work all the way through the 25 minutes. You are not allowed to take a break or do anything except work on your designated task. This is a form of precommitment, which is a simple way of decreasing **impulsiveness**. Many times a problem that seems insurmountable is actually very easy if you spend a minute thinking about it.

You will occassionally see a tomato (🍅) beside certain points in this book. You should interpret these as things to *actually sit down and spend a pomodoro doing*. If 25 minutes feels like too long to you at first, try doing 10 minutes. Our goal here is not to be a stickler for the number of minutes you spend getting motivated, but instead to help you internalize and develop these habits.

The pomodoro technique works. Try it. You will not be disappointed.
