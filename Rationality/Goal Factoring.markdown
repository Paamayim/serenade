## Introduction

I find it very difficult to strategically create long-term goals. Creating the
goals is easy, but the key word here is "strategically". Some of my goals
include:

- learn everything I can
- save the world
- create a work of art that might one day inspire someone
- become a recognized concert pianist

At first glance, it's hard to see the underlying theme behind these goals, and
probably the reason of this is that no such theme exists. Optimizing my life to
complete all of these goals is tricky - which should I attempt to do first? Is
there some task that will accomplish all of them simultaneously? Without
understanding why my brain wants the things it wants, any analysis on the topic
is difficult. There's a metaphor to real life here: you will often be surprised
about the interactions of corporeal objects if you don't understand the
underlying physics.

Goal factoring is a technique that can help you solve the question "why do I
want the things that I want?". It will make you a happier person, and startle
you with how much extra spare time you will be able to rustle up.

## Getting Started

First, grab a pencil and a piece of paper (or, if you're feeling fancy,
[yEd](#yed)). At the top of the page, start by jotting down an activity you seem
to spend a lot of time doing, but don't particularly enjoy. My particular
example was **spending time on facebook**.

Congratulations! You're officially on your way to a more accurate mental model!
Give yourself a high-five, and we'll continue.

Below this activity, write down reasons why you engage in this activity, even
though you don't enjoy it. Things on my list were **staying in touch with
friends**, **maintaining a personal identity**, **performing social
experiments** and **instant messaging**, among others. Try to make this list as
comprehensive as you can. Once you have as many things as you can think of, try
the following [thought experiment](Thought Experiments): imagine that you have
completely cut this activity out of your life. Is there anything about it you
miss? If so, jot it down! Draw arrows from your activity to all of the subgoals
you have listed.

## Turtles All the Way Down

Pick one of your subgoals, and think about all of the reasons you do that.
Perform the same thought experiment, and write down more reasons. Pick a new
sub-subgoal, and write down reasons you do *that*. I'm sure you get the picture.

After a while, you will get to goals that either don't go anywhere, or loop
around in circles forever. **Don't panic!** This is good! What you've identified
here is one (or a strange loop) of your *terminal goals*. Common terminal goals
include **social acceptance**, **happiness**, **family**, **love**,
**survival**. You know, those things that everybody wants. The things that seem
good by their own virtue. You might want to indicate a terminal goal by shading
it a different color or otherwise highlighting it, so that you can quickly find
them later.

Now it's time to unwind your stack. Go back up a level, and recurse down a
different subgoal than the one you chose previously. Get back down to terminal
goals (it's okay if this goal has the same terminal values), and then choose a
different subgoal to analyze. Repeat this process of up-and-down graph
traversal, until your original activity is *chalked full of nodes*.

Great! There's no more to do! We're done, right?

*Wrong*. Now we pick a new activity, and factor that. It is likely that this
goal will go much faster. I found that most of my high-level activities shared
much of the same goal infrastructure after two or three metalevels. Complete
this goal entirely, and then pick a new one.

Keep going until you run out of things that you do with your life. Then start
picking things that you'd like to do (my **being a recognized concert pianist**
for example). Figure out why you want to do these abstract, long term things.
Make a note of whether or not these long term projects have the same form as the
activities that you *actually do*. This will be important for the analysis
later.

## The Reconstruction

Now that your brain is fully mapped out in terms of goal structure, we can do
something about it. Starting at one of your original activities, traverse goals
downwards until you cross what I refer to as the "line of enjoyability". This is
the point where a goal lineage goes from being something you don't like to
something you do. My facebook example has a relatively high line of enjoyability
- I don't like **spending time on facebook** but I do like **staying in touch
with friends**. The connection between these two nodes is where you have a
problem in your goal structure.

Sit for a moment, and brainstorm better ways of accomplishing the goal you do
enjoy, without having to do the part you don't. For me this could be **spend
time with people in real life** or **make more phone calls to friends** - both
activities I'd enjoy more than the superficiality of social networking.

For extra style points, try to group several alike lines of enjoyability, and
come up with one activity which would fix all of them.

After all of the lines of enjoyability below your activity have been taken care
of, you don't need to do that activity anymore. You can get all of the same
benefits more efficiently out of your reworked plans, which means you have just
created a block of spare time. A block of spare time where you used to be doing
something that you didn't like. It's just like magic, really.

## Timespans

    This section is still under progress.

[Geoff Anders](http://www.leverageresearch.org/) says that 10h worth of goal
factoring should be sufficient to notice significant benefits from this
technique, and that 50h should fully exhaust your mind of goal structure.

State how you want to get as abstract as possible, with examples.
Clarify about jotting down thought experiments.
Difference between wanting/having/feeling/trying.
How this can lead to self awareness.
Also things that you don't dislike.

## Yed

From Geoff Anders in private conversation:

1. Open yEd.
2. Create a new document.
3. Click the white background; a small yellow square should appear on the canvas.
4. Click the small yellow square so as to select it.
5. Click and drag one of the corners of the yellow square to resize it. Make it the default size you'd like your text boxes to be. You will be able to change this later.
6. Make sure the yellow square is still selected.
7. Look at the menu in the lower right. It is called "Properties View". It will show you information about the yellow square.
8. Click the small yellow square in the menu next to the words "Fill Color".
9. Select the color white for the Fill Color.
10. Lower in the menu, under "Label", there is an item called "Placement". Find it. Change Placement to "Internal" and "Center".
11. Right below Placement in the menu is "Size". Find it. Change Size to "Fit Node Width".
12. Right below Size is "Configuration". Find it. Change Configuration to "Cropping".
13. Right below Configuration is "Alignment". Find it. Ensure that Alignment is "Center".
14. In the upper toolbar, click "File" then "Preferences".
15. A menu will come up. Click the "Editor" tab.
16. You will see a list of checkboxes. "Edit Label on Create Node" will be unchecked. Check it.
17. Click Apply.
18. In the upper toolbar, click "Edit" then "Manage Palette".
19. A menu will come up. In the upper left there will be a button called "New Section". Click it.
20. Name the new section after yourself.
21. Verify that the new section has been created by locating it in the righthand list of "Displayed Palette Selections".
22. Close the Palette Manager menu.
23. Doubleclick your white textbox to edit its label.
24. Put in something suitably generic to indicate a default textbox. I use "[text]" (without the quotes).
25. Select your white textbox. Be sure that you have selected it, but are not now editing the label.
26. Right click the white textbox. A menu will appear.
27. On the menu, mouse over "Manage Palette", then select the palette you named after yourself.
28. On the righthand side of the screen, there will be a menu at the top called "Palette". Find it.
29. Scroll through the palettes in the Palette menu until you find the palette you named after yourself. Expand it.
30. You will see your white textbox in the palette you have named after yourself. Click it to select it.
31. Right click the white textbox in the palette. Select "Use as Default".
32. To check that you have done everything properly, click on the white background canvas. Did it create a white textbox like your original, and then automatically allow you to edit the label? If so, VICTORY! Otherwise, try the instructions again, use Help, fiddle with the defaults yourself.

Then...
a. Click the white background to create a box.
b. Click a box and drag to create an arrow.
c. Click an already existing box to select it. Once selected, click and drag to move it.
d. Doubleclick an already existing box to edit its label.

Then...
GOAL FACTORING!
