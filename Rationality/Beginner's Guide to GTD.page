## Beginner's Guide

This document will walk you through the steps of bootstrapping your very own [GTD]() system. Before you begin, you should be familiar with what we are trying to accomplish, which is available in the [GTD FAQ]().

## Remember The Milk

Remember The Milk is our main inbox and reminder system.

### Preparation

Sign up for a free account at [Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/Registration.action). Don't do anything here yet.

Sign up for a [Google account](https://accounts.google.com/NewAccount?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar%2Frender&followup=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fcalendar&service=cl) (where we will get our calendar from), if you don't have one already. Don't do anything here either.

Sign up for a free account at [Remember The Milk](https://www.rememberthemilk.com/signup/). 

Click on **Settings** in the top right corner.

Under the **General** tab (where you should be already), check the **Show Task Cloud on the Tasks screen** box. Click **Save Changes**.

Move to the **Lists** tab. Select the **All Tasks, Personal, Study, Work** lists, and under the **More Actions...** dropdown, select **Delete List**. You should be left with only two lists now. Click the **Add List** button, type *M*, and hit *ENTER* on your keyboard. *M* is where we will define our work.

Click on the Remember The Milk cow logo. This should return you to the task list. Press the following keys:
    i <DEL>

It should now say **You have no incomplete tasks in this list. Woohoo!**. Woohoo indeed!

### Brain Dump

Click on the **Add a new task** bar. Now it is time to clear your brain of everything you are trying to remember, and use Remember The Milk to do it for you instead.

Type out a quick memo to yourself about something that is on your mind that needs to be done, then press enter. Examples of this might be *feed the cat*, *take out the garbage*, *get my tires changed*, *write Grandma*, *redecorate my room*, *read 1984*, etc. Continue doing this until you can't come up with any more tasks that need to be done. 

Physically walk around your house, noting things which would be nice to have done. Examples: *clean the mirrors*, *replace that lightbulb*, *sweep*, *do laundry*, *figure out why the radiator doesn't emit very much heat*, etc. Enter these into Remember The Milk.

Hopefully by this point you have more than a screen's worth of memos to yourself. Now think about long term goals you have, or projects that you've been meaning to do for years. Put THESE too into Remember The Milk. Examples: *travel to Russia*, *write a novel*, *learn Korean*, *learn to play an instrument*, *read more Keats*, *find someone worth marrying*, *enjoy a beer on the top of Mount Everest*, *save the world*, etc. Write down absolutely everything you can think of, even if it sounds stupid or impossible. Don't be afraid to jot things down - it's better to get them out of your mind than to keep them swaddled up in there.

Do a mental sweep and see if any of the following topics jog your memory: *commitments to friends/family/associates/subordinates/customers/society*, *communications to make (emails, faxes, phone calls)*, *things that need to be scheduled*, *things you need to ask other people for*, *financial concerns (bills, budgeting, taxes, mortgages)*, *information/objects you're waiting for*, *upcoming events (birthdays, weddings, vacations, social events)*, *health care (doctors, dentists, optometrists)*, and finally *hobbies*. Write down everything that came up.

Is your list intimidatingly long? If so, great! If not, think of more things, you slacker.

### Defining Work

Now it's time to figure out how to accomplish each item in our to-do list.

Press the *ESCAPE* key on your keyboard. This should deselect the **Add a new task** bar.

Press the *I*, and then the "T" keys on your keyboard. The first item in your to-do list should be selected, and you should be back in the **Add a new task bar** (this is intentional). Type out the very first non-trivial action you would need to do to accomplish this goal, but don't hit enter yet. For example, if my task were "get my tires changed", I might write "find a mechanic who deals with tires". If my task were "read 1984", I might write "buy a copy of 1984". If my task were "learn to play an instrument", I might write "determine which instrument to learn to play". You get the idea.

Before pressing enter, we need to associate some metadata with this task. Type **#M** at the end of your task (this tells Remember The Milk to put this task in our reminder system, not the inbox). Don't press enter yet.

Determine whether the task:

- ABSOLUTELY MUST be finished by a certain date: append **^when it must be done by**. Examples: *^tomorrow*, *^sept 11*, *^three weeks from now*.
- is a subtask of a larger project: append **#projects**
- fits conveniently into a category (things like *correspondence*, *scheduling*, *homework*, *long term projects*, *errands*, etc): append **#category** (make sure to fill in the category with the one you selected)

Make sure your task fits into one of these three options. If not, consider making a **#misc** category, then immediately creating the task: "**sort out misc category #M #meta**" if you haven't already.

Hit the following keys on your keyboard: *ENTER*, *ESCAPE*, *DELETE*, *i*, *t*. The task you just completed should be deleted from the list, and you should have the next one selected.

Repeat this section until your inbox is empty.

***Pro-tip:** if your inbox is far too large to complete in one go, consider selecting all of the remaining tasks, assigning them the tag **#gtd** on the right side of the screen, moving them to the **M** list in the **More Actions** drop down list, then adding the following task "**finish defining work for the gtd tag #M #meta**"*.

Add the following tasks:
    is this necessary?

- "**convert projects into evernotes #M #meta**"
- "**schedule timeblocks for contexts #M #meta**"
- "**schedule a meta timeblock #M #meta**"
- "**think about other necessary inboxes #M #meta**"

## Google Calendar

### Preamble

Ok! Now that your reminder system is all set up and ready to rock, it's time to make a plan about how you're going to get it all done. This is where being well scheduled comes in.  Like it or not, humans are ritualistic creatures, and we get good at following routines. We're going to take advantage of this, and schedule as much of your life as possible. While it might make you feel like a robot, try not to think of it like this. Instead, try to frame it as turning you into a robot *of productivity*!. Sold yet? Probably not, but you will be after giving this a try.

### Preparation

Log into [Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/). If you have never used it before, don't despair - that's perfect! If you have, you're probably not being as effective as you could be.

On the left, click the little down arrow to the right of **My calendars**, then click **Settings**.  Below the word **CALENDAR** should be your name. Click on your name, and change the **Calendar Name** to "*External*". Make sure it has the **correct timezone**. Click **Save**.

Press the **Create new calendar** button, and fill in the name with "*GTD*". Press **Create Calendar**.

Repeat this process for the following calendars: "*Social*", "*Upkeep*", "*Flexible*", "*Deadlines*", as well as one for each exceptionally important person in your life (significant other, children, etc).

Each of these calendars represents a different facet of your life:

- *External*: this calendar is for rigid blocks of time over which you don't have control. Generally, work hours and other people's schedules which affect you will fall under this category.
- *GTD*: where you will allocate time to work on your Remember The Milk tasks.
- *Potential*: a calendar to track reoccurring events it would be nice, though unlikely, to get to.
- *Social*: this calendar is used for social engagements. While it's probably not necessary you attend these, it's very useful to keep a social calendar.
- *Upkeep*: a calendar for necessary, but boring parts of life. Here you will block your sleeping patterns, travel time, and other things that are done on a daily basis.
- *Relaxation*: this is a space to block off for downtime, When you start scheduling your entire life, it's easy to forget about spare time. 
- *Annotations*: use this calendar to mark weekly goals, or other meta-data useful for the scheduling phase.
- *Deadlines*: a psuedo-calendar to mark hard deadlines for projects. No matter what, tasks must be done before their time on this calendar is up.
- Important people: the reason behind this calendar is so that you can get a general feel for the schedule of people important to you. Knowing this means you can prioritize when you do things to ensure keeping the relationship optimal.

By hovering your mouse over the name of the calendar on the left, a down arrow will appear. Clicking on this will reveal a color swatch. Ensure each of your calendars has a distinct and meaningful color. Give your *Deadlines* calendar an exceptionally eye catching color, as you definitely always want this to be at the forefront of your mind.

### Scheduling

It's now time to fill in as much of your calendar as you can. Start with your *External* calendar - fill in as much detail about your rigid schedule as you can. Creating events in Google Calendar is outside the scope of this article, but the [help](https://support.google.com/calendar/?hl=en) page has a lot of great resources.

***Remember:** most of your External calendar will be reoccurring. Use Google Calendar's built-in rescheduling support to facilitate this.*

***Important:** don't forget to schedule time to travel between locations. Put this travel time in your Upkeep calendar.*

Now, fill in your *Upkeep* calendar. As accurately as you can, mark off when you sleep, your morning/evening routines, when you eat, and anything else you can think of that fits in this calendar. 

For each of your important people, fill in as much detail as you know. It doesn't have to be perfect - you can always ask them later (in fact, do so. This might pique their interest on a GTD system also)! 

After all of this work, you probably have a good idea of when your spare time is. Schedule the following under your *GTD* calendar:

- **one hour per week** to work on **Meta** tasks (we will discuss this in the next section).
- **one hour per week** to work on **Pragma** tasks (again, later).
- **one half hour per day** for strategizing - don't worry, you won't use all of this.
- **at least two [pomodoros](Pomodoros) per day** for GTD.
- **one pomodoro per day** to work on *Creative Recreation*
- **one pomodoro per day** to learn something new.
- **one pomodoro every second day** to work on **Projects**
- **one pomodoro every other day** to work on **Miscellaneous**

For now, schedule these daily pomodoros in anywhere you reliably have spare time. The point of the Strategy half hour is to ensure your schedule is sane, allocate your pomodoros to when you have time, and look at any tasks remaining in your **~Due** list.

### Getting (Meta) Things Done

So what's this weekly hour timeblock for **Meta** all about? Good question! Meta is your weekly time to improve GTD! You should spend it looking at what went well last week, what didn't, and changing things around to better suit your individual lifestyle. Don't be afraid to experiment during this period. I find it's also helpful to use **Meta** to strategize about **Projects**, set up my [Anki Decks](Anki), and other tasks which don't easily fit into my schedule.

**What's this pragma thingy? **

Your pragma block is the most surefire way of convincing you that GTD is a habit you want in your routine. It's an hour every week which you're allowed to spend on directly making your life better. Throughout the week, make a habit of inboxing any minor annoyances you come across, but which are too small to be worth dealing with. Pragma is your opportunity to improve these small irritants. After a couple of pragma timeblocks, you will be convinced that this system really works.
