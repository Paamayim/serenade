## Introduction

I find it very difficult to strategically create long-term goals. Creating the goals is easy, but the key word here is "strategically". Some of my goals include:
- learn everything I can
- save the world
- create a work of art that might one day inspire someone
- become a recognized concert pianist

At first glance, it's hard to see the underlying theme behind these goals, and probably the reason of this is that no such theme exists. Optimizing my life to complete all of these goals is tricky - which should I attempt to do first? Is there some task that will accomplish all of them simultaneously? Without understanding why my brain wants the things it wants, any analysis on the topic is difficult. There's a metaphor to real life here: you will often be surprised about the interactions of corporeal objects if you don't understand the underlying physics. 

Goal factoring is a technique that can help you solve the question "why do I want the things that I want?". 

## Getting Started

First, grab a pencil and a piece of paper (or, if you're feeling fancy, [Setting Up yEd](yEd)). At the top of the page, start by jotting down an activity you seem to spend a lot of time doing, but don't particularly enjoy. My particular example was "spending time on facebook".
