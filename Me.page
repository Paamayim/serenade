...

I am a programmer, a student, a rationalist, an engineer, a scientist, a game designer, an atheist, a mathemetician, a singer, a liberal, a philosopher, a lover of music, a teacher, an actor, and a writer. I believe in free speech, in free thought, in education, in socialism, in truth, in equal rights for everyone, in justice, in humanity, and I believe in myself, because when I don't succeed, I learn, and when I learn, I succeed. Life isn't always easy, but it's always good.
