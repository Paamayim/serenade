# Problem Spaces

A problem space is a generalization of a [CS Guide/Vector Space]() to the domain of a problem. If your car refuses to start, the space of this problem is *all of the possible reasons why the car isn't working*. Laying out our problem into some kind of metric space means we can "search" through it - searching through problem space is equivalent to *diagnosing and identifying the root cause*.

Once a problem is conceptually laid out in a metric space, we suddenly obtain the ability to query the space, ask questions about it, and eliminate possibilities. The questions we ask should be non-specific as possible so as to eliminate as much of the space as possible with each subsequent query.

An example of searching problem space with which you're probably familiar is the game "20 questions". In this game, one player thinks of an obscure noun, and the other has 20 yes or no questions to attempt to determine what the first player's noun is. As you can imagine, unless you're Goofy's son Max, your first question shouldn't be "is it Walt Disney?". On the first question, the possibilities are astronomical, and the likelihood of you guessing the exact same obscure noun as your opponent is slim to none.

A better strategy, however, is to ask very broad questions in an attempt to narrow down the possibilities as much as possible before you start guessing specific things. Some common questions are "is it a person?", "is it larger than a bread-box?" and "do you find this thing in North America?". Such questions, regardless of the answer, narrow down the possibilities immensely.

For convenience, we will define a unit - the bit. 1 bit is powerful enough to cut our search-space in half. You might notice a similarity between this concept and the idea of a yes/no question. A perfectly chosen yes/no question will cut the possible answers in half, so in theory, any boolean question contains 1 bit of information.

Armed with the knowledge of a bit, we can go further, and decide how difficult a problem is by the number of bits we need in order to be left with just one answer. Keen readers will realize that this is equivalent to taking the $log_2$ of the problem size. For example, in order to narrow down the population of Canada to only one citizen, $log_2 30000000 = ~24.8$.
