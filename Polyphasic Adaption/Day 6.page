##Day 6: 2013-02-21

My core last night was interrupted temporarily in the last half hour of sleep, riding on the shoulders of the majestic sounds of vomiting. In a rebellious upset, before going to bed I delayed my alarm by the amount of time I had been up, hopefully trying to get the same amount of sleep. At the time this seemed like a good idea, but in retrospect I doubt I was going to get the deep sleep I had been missing by sleeping for an extra 15 minutes after having been awakened. 

Somehow, my core turned into a monophasic sleep. **Eight hours** in total! While this is not a good thing, it espouses a strange fact: I feel *exhausted*, right now. A further insight states that I feel *normal* right now. This thought alone makes my polyphasic experiment successful, and the fact that I feel better while doing it makes me want to continue, despite this morning's hardships.
 
Initially, my thoughts on why I cored so hard is a mixture of fucking up my naps last night and my body capitalizing on whatever sleep it could. I will have to reflect on this further to come up with a real answer.

**So good news: polyphasing seems like a better sleep schedule for me.**
