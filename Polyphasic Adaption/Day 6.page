##Day 6: 2013-02-21

My core last night was interrupted temporarily in the last half hour of sleep, riding on the shoulders of the majestic sounds of vomiting. In a rebellious upset, before going to bed I delayed my alarm by the amount of time I had been up, hopefully trying to get the same amount of sleep. At the time this seemed like a good idea, but in retrospect I doubt I was going to get the deep sleep I had been missing by sleeping for an extra 15 minutes after having been awakened. 

Somehow, my core turned into a monophasic sleep. **Eight hours** in total! While this is not a good thing, it espouses a strange fact: I feel *exhausted*, right now. A further insight states that I feel *normal* right now. This thought alone makes my polyphasic experiment successful, and the fact that I feel better while doing it makes me want to continue, despite this morning's hardships.
 
Initially, my thoughts on why I cored so hard is a mixture of fucking up my naps last night and my body capitalizing on whatever sleep it could. I will have to reflect on this further to come up with a real answer.

**So good news: polyphasing seems like a better sleep schedule for me.**

My core went so long that I missed my first nap. Second nap went well. Third nap? Well I laid down at 11pm, with my alarm set for 11:20pm, and...

# CATASTROPHE

I slept until 2:20am instead. My alarm **was** set, but **wasn't** running.

**Fuck fuck fuck / fuck fuck fuck / fuck fuck fuck / fuck fuck fuck / fuck fuck fuck / fuck fuck fuck** (to the tune of a waltz).

"Myself, how bad is this?" you might be asking yourself. Let me answer this for you. [This is unhappy. It's bad. It's disgusting. It's very bad. It's horrifying. It's sad. It's incredibly awful.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_75SUwTJg54&feature=player_detailpage#t=222s). In twenty four hours, I've literally managed to get **twelve hours of sleep**. THAT IS HALF OF MY ENTIRE DAY.

FUCK.

To prevent this in the future, I have gone back to using my phone's built-in alarms (the kind that never aren't running), as well as my fancy dancy new ones. The plan falls apart if my phone isn't on/nearby, but we'll bridge that cross when we get to it.

I am extremely disheartened, but intend to pop a bunch of melatonin in an attempt to get my regular core tonight, and we will all be crossing our thumbs (right? RIGHT?) that tomorrow will be better.
