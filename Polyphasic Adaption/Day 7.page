## Day 7: 2013-02-22

I *almost* successfully moved back into my regularly scheduled sleeping. I slept in for an extra hour this morning. After learning that I can FORCE QUIT my alarm off without having to actually get out of bed, it has become significantly less effective. This requires some cognition on means of fixing.

My first Correspondence contextual timeblock went extremely well. My first email was slow, but each one was a little faster. This gives me the sense that contextual blocking is more efficient than task blocking - something I had assumed but never verified. I followed this by doing a block of meta meditation (which transitioned into meditation after all of the meta was done), where I developed a means of recording the results of my meditations, and I also accidentally developed a filing system in the mean time. The solution is to use [evernote](http://evernote.com/), with a note for every meditation, project, and topic for things I want to remember over long time periods.

The remainder of meditation was spent on two topics: "a list of things I procrastinate" and "a list of the most important ideas I've never acted on". Both of these seem like they will contain lots of low-hanging fruit to optimize for big results. I haven't gotten around to doing that yet, but having the lists down and out of my brain means I can think about them subconsciously.

On that note: I find that my problem-solving abilities work by setting my subconscious on a task in parallel. Whenever it comes up with insights, it raises an interrupt in my conscious, saying "hey, look at all of these things I figured out". Inspired problem-solving occurs when my conscious and subconscious are working on the same problem, usually from (what I'd assume to be) opposite directions. Menial solutions come from doing the whole thing in conscious space.

I'm not very sleepy these days. Staying up all night is pretty easy, as long as I'm not reading in bed. Significant sleepiness happens around all of my scheduled sleep times. Booyakasha!

The naps went pretty regularly, with the exception of being awakened from my 5:20pm by a phone call. This is the second time it's happened, and I *really* need to start turning off my service. Luckily, the call was for a job offer, so I wasn't too upset about the whole thing. Now that my mental state has stabilized, these posts seem a little moot. I think if nothing exceptional happens tomorrow, I will not post. Should anything exceptional happen (including a dropping BPI on lumosity), I will reestablish contact.

School starts again on Monday. That's when all of this gets put to the test.

Thanks for reading! It's been a lot of fun :)
