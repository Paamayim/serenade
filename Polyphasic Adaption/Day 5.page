## Day 5: 2013-02-20

Let's review some recent facts. My new alarm clock is working much better than my old alarm clock. Today's naps were impeccable, well mostly. All of my morning naps were well scheduled, and from them I easily awoke. Waking from my 9am nap left me extremely tired, so I counted by consuming my regiment of potassium, choline and piracetam, which has proven itself as stimulating my mind enough to wake me up. I decided to read at 10:45am, because regardless of what people say, it's perfectly safe for me to read and expect to stay awake.

Wait, no it's not. Only kidding. I had fallen asleep. Every time I unexpectedly fall asleep it is due to reading. Every damn time. Fuck you - [HPMOR](http://hpmor.com/) - for being so gripping. Luckily I awoke an hour later. To be more precise, I was awakened an hour later by an unexpected glass of water which had been thrown at me by my girlfriend. Classic move. Page one **How To Wake People Up for Dummies** maneuver. My mood spiked to instantaneous rage, but just as quickly moved to awe. Well played!

In retaliation, I had half of an energy drink to maintain my wakefulness around 12:30pm. 

My memory seems to have improved. I can recall these details like mad, but my ability to concentrate has gone down the drain. I keep finding myself glazing over my calendar trying to jog things to write about.

Due to being out and about (locating birthday presents, buying dreadlock supplies, cutting my heel on a door, wearing shorts in -16C [with the wind chill] weather), I missed my 5pm nap by about 15 minutes. I decided it wasn't worth attempting to do (my body was super sleepy at 5pm, and promptly woke up again. I think this is a good sign.), and instead spent two hours dicking around with my dreadlocks. They look incredible, if you were wondering, which I know you were.

I had the other half of an energy drink at 5:30pm.

At 7:30 I was exhausted, so decided to take my nap then. In an attempt to renormalize my schedule, I napped again at 8:30pm (not quite my regular time, but much better than skipping one by three hours), which I assumed was enough time for my body to ask for more REM. My parents called in the middle of the nap, which I admit was not an issue I was expecting to have. Note to self: disable incoming messages during naps.

Needless to say, my sleep schedule was fucked. My original plan was for this to be the last day of uberman, although I had recently intended to do one more day since I had been a little sloppy with my timing. Having screwed up everything so badly, I've decided to start everyman 3 tonight, as I think that re-adapting to uberman will be counterproductive at best.

We went out for $4 martinis. I haven't been drinking whatsoever since starting this crazy schedule, and I was kind of craving alcohol (alcoholism? probably. we'll think about this after polyphasing is stable). I spent $12 on martinis - the math of how many I consumed is left as an exercise for the reader. The last martini was espresso, which I figured would help the depressive affects of the booze.

Tomorrow I get almost a real amount of sleep. You have absolutely no idea how excited I am about this.

Lumosity: same training preferences as yesterday.

Spatial 1-backing: pretty poor. I couldn't seem to concentrate (could be the booze, but I doubt it.). 55% below personal best, 11% below median.

One game I had never played before.

Finding words that start with stems was second to personal best, 7% below. I couldn't think of very many words that start with "ran". Can you? **rang ranch ranches rancher rancour**. Upon typing this I came up with **rancid**, which is a [wonderfully corporeal band](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNe4AETjlb0).

I've been playing a lot of Penguin Pursuit over the last few days, and I've noticed something very disconcerting. I'm pretty sure that damn enemy penguin is doping. HE NEVER MAKE A MISTAKE. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY NAVIGATE A ROTATING MAZE PERFECTLY EVERY TIME? Regardless of this, set a personal best by one round. Eat it, stupid computer penguin. Go eat more shark steroids.

Brain shift overdrive I placed just below yesterday's personal best, behind by only one correct answer.

End of day BPI: 1324

I'm going to go get some well earned sleep now. Starting tomorrow I would expect this blog to be significantly less loopy. Whether or not this is a good thing is something only time can tell.
