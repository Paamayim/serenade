## Day 1: 2013-02-16

First sleepless night was unsuccessful - ended up putting in two hours of interrupted core sleep rather than going directly into bifurcated uberman. This is probably ok, since a gentle adaption is recommended have occured before going directly to uberman. I think my body is still a little on edge from my last polyphasic attempt, so it seems to be "chillin'".

I fell asleep (potentially intentially, perhaps not - sleeplessness has an effect on my memory) while reading HPMOR. There was were distinct 30 minutes during which my eyes would drift closed and I would forcibly open them. I did not have any of my consciousness tools with me at the time.

Fasting for a day before starting polyphasic sleep is extremely useful. Apparently the circadian clock can be megahacked by food. I find that a big meal after a nap will drastically increase my energy. 

Lying in bed significantly increases tiredness, especially while watching TV. This is to be expected. Perhaps related, perhaps not, my first day of napping incurred serious waves of **tiredness at 12:30pm,  5:30pm and 1:30am**.  By 2:15am, tiredness had significantly decreased.

Dinner was eaten around **7:30pm** - foolishly I forgot to record lunch, but it was probably around **1pm**.

Naps were for 20 minutes, in well lit rooms.

Consciousness aids included splashing cold water on my face, **396mg of potassium at 6:00pm** and a **coffee at 8:00pm**. Four or five cups of chai tea were consumed during my all nighter, and four hours of Left 4 Dead were played.

Mentally, I feel slow, but not handicapped in any severe manner. Diction is difficult, and sentences come out slowly. Awkward pauses occur in the middle of writing phrases. Piracetam might assuage these issues.

I was unable to make much progress on my homework, though I am not sure this is entirely relevant. A general disinterest in the project and misunderstanding of the underlying technologies are probably also correlated. That being said, reasoning about my changes to the program are impaired, and likely are incorrect.

Mood has been brighter than usual. I find myself in a sillier mood, with more creative potential. Last night I was freestyling rap verses better than usual, and all day I have been throwing out strange ideas that have made people laugh. This may have been due to the sleep deprivation making me loopy. Other factors which might be correlated are the beginning of 9 days off, and a very successful job interview yesterday.

A fair amount of againstness was experienced this morning directly upon waking from my short core, but it quickly dissipated. The inside view of cause seemed to be that nobody supported me on this quest, which I still believe to be the case, although everyone seems to desperately care about my wellbeing. This is an acceptable trade off.
