## Day 3: 2013-02-18

My body gave up on polyphasing last night. A 20 minute nap turned into a 5hour core. I was NOT impressed.

First nap at usual time was unsuccessful. Second felt like my eyes were exhibiting REM while I was still awake - or perhaps I was still lucid in my dream. It was uncomfortable. I'm getting really good at falling asleep though. My 20 minute naps feel like an hour worth of sleep each time.

UNFORTUNATELY I am so behind on sleep that this isn't much of a respite.

I can feel my cognitive abilities deteriorating. I had pizza for lunch!

Had a chat with Valentine. He gave me lots of good advice, but some of it in particular was related to polyphasing: be SUPER SERIOUS about napping. Don't be later than 2 minutes to a nap. Ever. **Definitely don't** skip naps. Set up like eleven alarms all around your room so there is NO WAY you can ever sleep through it.

I really like that last point. It's my jam. I already stole Austin's fancy dancy alarm clock.

WOW I FUCKING CANT READ CALENDARS. Just took my nap 30 minutes early, after agonizing all day about being on-the-dot timing wise.
