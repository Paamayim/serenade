## Day 3: 2013-02-18

My body gave up on polyphasing last night. A 20 minute nap turned into a 5hour core. I was NOT impressed.

First nap at usual time was unsuccessful. Second felt like my eyes were exhibiting REM while I was still awake - or perhaps I was still lucid in my dream. It was uncomfortable. I'm getting really good at falling asleep though. My 20 minute naps feel like an hour worth of sleep each time.

UNFORTUNATELY I am so behind on sleep that this isn't much of a respite.

I can feel my cognitive abilities deteriorating. I had pizza for lunch!

Had a chat with Valentine. He gave me lots of good advice, but some of it in particular was related to polyphasing: be SUPER SERIOUS about napping. Don't be later than 2 minutes to a nap. Ever. **Definitely don't** skip naps. Set up like eleven alarms all around your room so there is NO WAY you can ever sleep through it.

I really like that last point. It's my jam. I already stole Austin's fancy dancy alarm clock.

Third nap went well. Being woken up by three alarms is pretty baller. I likes it a lot. If only I could figure out a way to synchronize them so they would play individual tracks of a phat beat, that would be perfect.

My fourth nap of the day (1am) was unsuccessful. Upon getting out of bed, I went at my calendar to mark off the lack of success and... WOW I FUCKING CANT READ CALENDARS. Just took my nap 30 minutes early, after agonizing all day about being on-the-dot timing-wise. My nap was supposed to be at 1:30am! By the time 1:30am rolled around I was exhausted and definitely needed the nap, although my girlfriend was over and I felt it was unfair to make her wait around for the better part of an hour because I am dysnomic. 

Helpfully, she suggested sex might wake me up. It was not nearly as successful as yesterday. I feel it is unwise to divulge this information, however. Keep it secret; keep it safe.

Potassium was, however, successful. I am woken the hell up.

Today's food consisted of a deluxe pizza that I meticulously de-deluxed. I had defrosted a chicken breast to eat before this, and it is still sitting in my fridge. I wonder if it will be okay to eat tomorrow? Then again, having sleep deprivation AND food poisoning sounds like a whole less fun than I'm currently having...

Lumosity results: I scored a personal best on 2-backing, by 33%. Personal best on moving object tracking, although this was only my second time playing the game. Personal best on sorting words by unknown rules, but again, second time playing ever. Comparing results of mathematical expressions was 6200 compared to a top best range between 8300 to 6600. Solving rotating matrices was 0.044% less than my personal best.

Resulting BPI: 1311.

Conclusion: no negative cognitive side effects are present. Further conclusion: I should be prioritizing different aspects of lumosity every day, to ensure that ie my problem solving skills are fine, but my attention isn't. 

My memory, however, is definitely impaired. I will attempt to get some numbers on this impairment tomorrow.

I still feel cognitively capable. I'm going to GTD with the rest of my night (I have begun considering the 5:30am nap to be conclusively the end of the day).
