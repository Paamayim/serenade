## Day 4: 2013-02-19

Nothing interesting happened today. Move along, move along.

JUST KIDDING SO MANY FUN THINGS HAPPENED TODAY

JUST KIDDING AGAIN FOOLED YOU HAH HAHA

I'm a little bit sleepy.

One of my naps turned into a core again. This is Bad News(TM), so I did away with having multiple alarms, and instead looked for a technological secret formula to be the way to wake up. What I found was an alarm clock app for my phone which requires me to run out of bed and scan random bar codes and shake it like it's a milk shake. This definitely wakes me up, and also brings all of the boys to the yard.

I am unable to distinguish between sleep and not sleeping during my naps. Either the sleep is lucid enough that I don't realize I'm entering it, or maybe I'm just not actually sleeping and I'm really tired. WHO KNOWS I don't. Not me. Nosireee bobby lee pants.

My closest and most personal of friends, Laura recommended that I should take up cooking in my new amounts of copious spare time. I made that chicken up from yesterday and hoped against hope that it wasn't in fact plagued by the chicken pox. Which is to say food poisoning, or whatever you get when you leave raw meat out on the counter for a day.

Don't worry though. I fried it really good. Not well, but good. It helped children in Africa.

it was really tasty. Thanks for the good idea, Laura! 

I did a bunch of pomodoros for what I was previously calling "technical metas". These are timeblocks in which I attempt to solve things that have been annoying me, but aren't actually issues by themselves. I came up with the dope-sickest name: pragma blocks. I actually stopped my pomodoro in order to rename them on my calendar.

ANYWAY I reorganized my room so that it is more effectively effective and efficiently efficient to do things in it. I removed about 80L of unused boxes and stupid thingamabobbies from my room, and it feels delicious. So was my chicken, if I didn't mention that. Way to go, Laura! Thanks for the suggestion!

Also I played some video juegos. I don't think they were very interesting though, cause I can't remember them. Except for "Koanandodo" which is a mafuggin great name. I'm going to name everything I can Koanandodo from now on. My shopping carts, my children, my testicles? I'm not sure yet, but we'll find something.

I used to name things "Albert" but that is sooooo 2009. Good times, '09.

Okay here's the stuff you all care about. Lumosity reports. Today in the spirit of thanksgiving, I reorganized my core focus groups into FROM MOST IMPORTANT TO less important: Memory, attention, flexibility, speed, problem solving. My games were as follows. You ready? I'm ready. So ready.

First we did some 3-backing. I achieved a personal best by 40%. No big deal or nothin', but I'm kind of a big deal or something.
Tracking patterns through rotations is by far my worst game while I'm not sleep deprived, but unsurprisingly I am much worse at it with sleeplessness. I got 4th out of my top 5, but it's only 63% of my personal best score. Whatever, that one is stupid.
Penguin racing problem solving was 86% of yesterday's score, but that's still an "A" if you think about it. "A" for something that is of or pertaining to penguins, because I can't come up with a word.

Don't worry though, I killed monster garden. I'm not sure how to describe monster garden except that it is stupid. Who would put monsters in a garden!?!?!? You'd need to fallow extra hard the following year to grow anything else methinks. When I was a kid my dad and I used to play a game called "monster pillow". It's not very relevant to the story, but I just wanted to share that.

Categorizing lexemes by mutually exclusive binary classifications, I merked. Usually I am not so good at this, but today I was so good at this. You might say that i SHIFTED OVERDRIVE. Or that I was driving a sports car....

IN FIRST GEAR!

Oh yeah, and a whole bunch of people want to employ me. Turns out I'm not just terribly fun to look at, but also smart too!
