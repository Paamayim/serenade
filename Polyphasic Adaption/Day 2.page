## 2013-02-17: Day 2

I took my first nap of the subjective "day" (such things are harder to define without the convenient Schelling point that is several hours of sleep) at 2:30am. I awoke and was sleepy, and consumed three high-protein sausage snacks, and two highly-unhealthy poptart snacks. After completing my entry on the first day of polyphasic adaption, I was in the mood for serenading, but was awfully sleepy. I took my daily regiment of piracetam and choline - which always helps get me in the spirit of writing - and waited for it to hit. I didn't wait very long.

I wrote a whole bunch about [/Instrumental Rationality/GTD]().
