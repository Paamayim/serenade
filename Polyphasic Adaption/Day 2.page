## 2013-02-17: Day 2

I took my first nap of the subjective "day" (such things are harder to define without the convenient Schelling point that is several hours of sleep) at 2:30am. I awoke and was sleepy, and consumed three high-protein sausage snacks, and two highly-unhealthy poptart snacks. After completing my entry on the first day of polyphasic adaption, I was in the mood for serenading, but was awfully sleepy. I took my daily regiment of piracetam and choline - which always helps get me in the spirit of writing - and waited for it to hit. I didn't wait very long.

I wrote a whole bunch about [/Instrumental Rationality/GTD](). Initially, dirty rap music seemed like the appropriate musical accompaniment, however this quickly turned to classical baroque when I found myself concentrating too much on the music instead of the writing. Baroque turned out to be much more appealing and appropriate.

After playing the remainder of a week old lumosity sitting, my brain felt physically slower, like it was computing through molasses. Categorizing between even/odd and vowel/constanent felt extremely muddy, though I scored in my top 5 scores. My mental math was slower than usual for individual problems, but when the problems started streaming at me I felt almost as if I were communing with the numbers. My final score in the mathematics department was within 5% of my personal best. Ability to intrinsically count was 9 rounds of perfect, with one round of being off by one (however I had never played this game before so I had no baseline with which to compare these numbers). This game did not feel difficult whatsoever, which I expect is correlated with the fact that it doesn't require any cognition, but rather intuitive judgement.

I found that once again, one of my naps turned into three naps (90 minutes or so). This occured at the same time as yesterday, which makes me think my brain is still associating this nap with core sleep. This whole sleep adjustment thing sucks, but it doesn't suck nearly as much as I was expecting it to. I'm not sure if this is due to my cheating core sleeps, or just that I am an extremely rugged and virile man who knows no bounds.

My homework afforded to get done. I found a bunch of flaws in reasoning that I had made earlier (this implies to me that I am functioning more than I was yesterday). It's not a well done, cared for solution, but it's a pass. Caring! Yeah!

I took naps today at **1:30pm**, **5:00pm**, and **2:00am**. I think I cheated sometime between 3:00am and 4:00am, because i was *very* startled by a Skype call that I was expecting. Perhaps the reason I have been feeling pretty good about this adjustment period is that my body has been lying to me and is in fact sleeping regular amounts. Craft bugger. Food wasn't explicitly tracked (or if it was, then I'm simply not trusting my calendar). My calendar says I ate at **3:00am**, **11:30am** and **9:30pm**. I'm pretty certain these numbers are all lies. Furthermore, I can't tell you what I did eat. At two points were perogies involved, but I'm pretty sure there were other things.

*It is evident that my memory is fading*. Tomorrow, memory willing, I will write down more details as they happen for better logging purposes. I just wrote future-me a note to remind me to remember things. If that's not meta as heck, I don't know what is.

Around 4pm I had a beer. This turned uberman into uberhardman. WOW depressants are not helpful for staying awake. This fact + polyphasic sleeping will probably have positive effects on the health of my liver. I'm not just dicking around with *things man was never meant to dick with*, but I'm getting healthy too :). Eat those bones, naysayers.

Around 6pm I consumed half of my monster energy drink. It counteracted the beer. After two hours I was extremely sleepy once more, but sex proved useful here. I think sex has given me the most energy out of all of the things I've tried so far. Neat. I think this will come in handy as a bargaining tool in the future.

~~No other drugs were consumed "today". Except for the piracetam/choline I mentioned in the morning. You know what, scratch this whole paragraph.~~

I did my first meditation timeblock today. It was on the state of my relationship (thankfully the meditation turned out positive). I can see lots of potential in scheduling regular times to sit down and think about life, but I *currently do not have the systems in place* to accomplish this satisfactorily. It begets a pomodoro, but of a significantly smaller duration, which none of my tools allow. I feel like it needs to be serenaded in order to be trustworthy (I should write about this sometime - noted), but on the other hand, a lot of it feels extremely personal, and like it might step on toes.

Conflict!

My days are chalked full of things that I want to get done with my extra hours a day, but these tasks never seem to get done. Each successive day just gets busier. I hope this is a result of the sleep deprivation, and not anything more systematic.

I realized today that I want to do science, and that's what this polyphasic project is all about. We're getting a datapoint for future generations to marvel about.

Tomorrow I start doing a strict uberman - taking all of my naps when I should and not dicking around with them. After a few days of that (or until I can no longer hack it), I'm going to jump into everyman 3. It is my intention that having been so sleep deprived my body will love me for getting three hours of nightly core, and we can hold hands and promptly forget about all of this silly business, happily with four extra hours a night. I don't think this is particularly unlikely.

I am noticably more dehydrated while polyphasing. I wonder why this is.
