## 2013-02-17: Day 2

I took my first nap of the subjective "day" (such things are harder to define without the convenient Schelling point that is several hours of sleep) at 2:30am. I awoke and was sleepy, and consumed three high-protein sausage snacks, and two highly-unhealthy poptart snacks. After completing my entry on the first day of polyphasic adaption, I was in the mood for serenading, but was awfully sleepy. I took my daily regiment of piracetam and choline - which always helps get me in the spirit of writing - and waited for it to hit. I didn't wait very long.

I wrote a whole bunch about [/Instrumental Rationality/GTD](). Initially, dirty rap music seemed like the appropriate musical accompaniment, however this quickly turned to classical baroque when I found myself concentrating too much on the music instead of the writing. Baroque turned out to be much more appealing and appropriate.

After playing the remainder of a week old lumosity sitting, my brain felt physically slower, like it was computing through molasses. Categorizing between even/odd and vowel/constanent felt extremely muddy, though I scored in my top 5 scores. My mental math was slower than usual for individual problems, but when the problems started streaming at me I felt almost as if I were communing with the numbers. My final score in the mathematics department was within 5% of my personal best. Ability to intrinsically count was 9 rounds of perfect, with one round of being off by one (however I had never played this game before so I had no baseline with which to compare these numbers). This game did not feel difficult whatsoever, which I expect is correlated with the fact that it doesn't require any cognition, but rather intuitive judgement.
