## On Supervillainy

It seems to me that any strong devotion to rationality will eventually result in supervillainy. The supervillain will have fewer scruples about achieving his goals, and having fewer constraints implies creating better solutions towards goals.

"Aha!" you proclaim, "we value nonsupervillainy in itself to prevent this very thing!". While this is true, the argument fails when we consider timelessness. While it is indeed true that one will gain utility from sticking to ones principles, then the same utility gain can be won by first modifying the preference structure, and then reaping the rewards of the new principles and the unconstrained goal paths.

Superheroism can thus only be the rational decision if and only if one of the following holds true:

1. supervillainy does not more easily facilitate goals
2. the utility gained from being a hero is non-equivicable when applied to supervillainy
3. heroic utility far outweighs villanous means

 

None of these appeals to my sense of obviousness. This is a problem. 

If we define a supervillain as one who is unafraid of exploiting the dark arts, all else being equal, the villain gains immediate optimization power from these new techniques. Without a doubt, being known to possess dark arts can signal villainy and thus decrease the power others are willing to bestow - although an ideal rationalist should be capable of knowing when this is an acceptable trade. We can thus argue that a supervillain will only obtain utility through the use of villainy. Point (1) seems to be counterfactual.
