## The Serenade Project

Serenade intends to be a long-running collection of Sandy Maguire's essays in various stages of completion.

If you are looking for ways of improving your life, [Rationality/]() contains a series of articles on just this. It has varying topics on getting things done, realizing your potential, and evaluating the future. I plan to one day turn this content into a book, though fully intend to keep it freely available here for all time.

You can view the [**List of Started Pages**](Table of Contents), or a list of proposed topics [here](Idea Jotpad). The content is still very young, but that's only because I am also.
