## Why?

Out of all resources, attention is the most important. Even small annoyances can cascade into big problems. This decreases stress, increases functional conscientiousness (correlated with academic and business success, as well as being trainable), and likely makes you achieve long term goals.

## Basic Idea
- Collecting work - remembering things that need to be done
- *Collection bins*
- Defining work - realizing what needs to be done, prioritizing
- *Reminder system*
- Doing work - getting things done

**Don't trust your brain for things your brain is not trustworthy for.**

Important part is to have a system that is good enough so that you can iterate over it and build it incrementally. It must be stable at the metalevel.

## Collecting work
Anything that comes into your world needs to be collected and needs to be in a recallable form. **Apply this everywhere**.
[Timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system) any ideas you can't explicitly write down.
Add as many inboxes as necessary. Every situation should have an inbox corresponding to it, but have as few as you can get away with. 

- Use [remember the milk](http://rememberthemilk.com) as a good starting inbox. Gmail is also good.

## Setting up RTM
- Delete all lists.
- Make a new list called MAIN.
- Create a new smart list with "dueBefore:now" and name it as "~Due"
- Enable "Task Clouds" in Settings > General 

## Situations to have inboxes
- **in general: it happened; how can i record it?**
- Middle of the night - dream journal
- gtasks for when no internet
- shower is a problem. think about this some more.
- during sex - attempt to project idea into the sex itself

Look for gaps in your collection system. When you find one, figure out a way to fix it.

## Mind dump
- Dump anything you have in your mind. Anything you feel a nag to do.
- Do a mental sweep of your house. Do a real sweep of your house.
- Do a mental sweep of projects you've been meaning to do for years.
- Sweep [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LzFstEXjRwXELqRILrsQMrFM2NEiLSqMhZBj39Ur_5s/edit)

## Setting up your reminder system
- Break down to-dos into next actions: what physical action comes right before doing the action? *For example: "deal with car tires" is bad. "google search for a nearby tire shop" is good*
- Attach due dates to things that only ABSOLUTELY need to be done by the due date
- If something takes more than one next action to complete it's a *project*
    - Only when there are multiple paralllel branches. 
    - Make a [mind map](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) for every project (or [workflowy](https://workflowy.com/))
- You don't have daily to-dos, but instead:
    - Your system will give you timely reminders when you need them
    - Most to-dos will be based on contexts of doablility.

**The reminder system has to be trustable**

## Main components
- Use RTM as a reminder system
- Use a calendar to schedule things with other ([Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/render?tab=wc&pli=1&gsessionid=IP0QMUQyk34N-77Lw_pWzA))
- Always keep RTM and Google Cals tabs open (you can set up awesome to do this)
- Project materials
    - A project list (embedded in RTM)
    - A mind map for each project
    - A consistent place or set of places for project files **vvv**
- A filing system
    - Electronic ([Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/?src=shmodel))
    - Physical (filing system)

## Calendar components
Make a million calendars (time blocks, things that would be nice, events, reminders, things to consider)
**Ensure you allocate travel time** 

## Defining contexts
What is a context? Things you can do without a context switch - located by location or by logical connection.
Some contexts:
- A google todo list for each person I usually do work with (so while interacting you can switch to it and attack them as much as you can)
- Errands
- Home
- Internet with keyboard (writing lengthy emails)
- Internet without a keyboard (reading articles)
- School
- Phone calls

Contexts are a little insane, because you get caught up doing trivial things - not for saving the world (or other important projects).

Track a meta context sorted by time, as well as keeping track of contexts. This shouldn't be a part of the real GTD:

## Time blocking
Block out times that are fixed in a certain calendar. 

Block out flexible times in a different calendar. 

Block out a time to focus on meta tasks
- Work on time blocking
- For each context, block out an hour to explicitly work on it
- Make a block to remove unnecessary items if they are not being used

## Implementing contexts in RTM
Implement contexts as locations. Use the name as the name of the context. **Use one word context names** because sometimes RTM gets stupid.
- For location-based contexts, use the real location.
- For logical contexts, use the north pole.

## Emptying collection bins workflow
- Collection bins
- Can I ignore it? (Y: trash)
- Requires action? (N: filing system)
- Defining next action
- <2 min to do? (Y: do it now!)
- Can I delegate? (N: context list)
- Delegate
- Follow-up reminder ([boomerang](http://www.boomeranggmail.com/))

Guidelines:
- Process the top item first
- Process one item at a time
- **Never** put anything back into an inbox.

Remember: we want to *define work*, not *do work*. If you are good at this you can do 50 in 10 minutes.

Strategy: estimate how long it will take to empty. Make your estimate a little less sane than you originally expect. Try to beat the time. Time how long it takes, and then reflect on the relationship between your estimate and the real time.

## Processing queue
If easy:

> i t "next action @context #MAIN" <enter> <esc> <del>

If project:

> i t "Set a time to think about <project> #MAIN #tag" <enter> <esc> <del>

Can set importance with:

> !1

Can set time with:

> ^<when>

## Do the same thing with email
(todo)

## How to get things done
-Check Due list in the morning.
-If you have a reasonable belief that future you will be significantly better at a task than you, schedule it to them.
-This completes urgent items.
-Check calendar, ensure it is reasonable.
-Have rules for when to schedule contexts and projects. Use reminders to schedule this.

During meta schedule, assign due and inbox time blocks. While working on a context, scan through the whole list to assign relative importance.

## TODO
Read about implementation details in google document.

## Misc
- Explore mnemonics. [Memory palaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci).
- Add a smart list of things that have been neglected many times, so we can reimagine if they're useful
