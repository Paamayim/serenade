## Serenade

For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to write and share my thoughts on life. I suspect this is not an uncommon thing, as everyone seems to have a blog, vlog, pinterest, tumblr, or what-have-you, and each and every one is filled with content the author feels reflects them in some way. I have tried all of these means of self-expression, and come to the conclusion that none of them are an effective means of sharing ideas. While it might give a kick of endorphins to share whatever you're feeling on a given day, as a general principle, these temporally-relevant expressions of the mind are never going to change the world. It's [impossible to get something right the first time](Progress over Perfection) - iteration is always necessary - and blogs, pinterest, tumbler, or what-have-yous do not share this paradigm of incremental improvement. They encourage cranking out as many posts as one has time for, and, unfortunately, not the mindset of perfecting important ideas.

Serenade is the best solution of which I know. Serenade is a personal wiki, with two important properties for combatting the battle of contemporarism. The first property is timelessness: Serenade is not organized by time, nor is it so capable. The other means of avoiding time-relevance is that it maintains a log of changes over time. This means it provides a very natural means of inspecting how ideas have come about, and for analyzing their evolution. The idea behind Serenade is is not mine, but [gwern's](http://www.gwern.net/About) (as far as I know). 

The intent is to keep Serenade running for the remainder of my lifetime. One big reason behind this is that I think it will be an amazingly useful personal resource in the future. I'll be able to reflect on my thoughts, and see how they've changed over the years. If there is any justice in the universe, it might provide a means of reverting to my past beliefs if necessary, or strengthening current beliefs if I can justify them all the way through time. The other significant reason behind Serenade is as a place to document myself for others. Perhaps one day the content will become well-enough written that it can serve as a resource for others. It is a firm belief of mine that understanding the way people think is amazingly more profound than understanding the way people are. Who I am doesn't matter; what does is how I operate, and under which assumptions.

So please, if this project seems interesting to you, please get involved. [Set up your own](Internals of Serenade) Serenade, and read through my ideas. I'd love to [hear any feedback](mailto: amaguire@uwaterloo.ca) you might have, and I wholeheartedly promise to attempt to respond to any and all responses I might receive.

Here's to the future.
