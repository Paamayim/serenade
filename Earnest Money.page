## Disclaimer

This is a *very* rough draft of a game plot I'm working on. Maybe one day it will be finished. It likely won't make a lot of sense to people who aren't me, but I'm sharing it here irregardless.

## Characters


**Lewis Long** aka **Lewis Peril**  
![image](/img/louis.png)  
Weight: 196.9 pounds  
Height: 5' 11"  
Workplace: Quick n' Clean Laundromat

**Akeem Peters** aka **Chievo**  
![image](/img/akeem.png)  
Weight: 167.6 pounds  
Height: 5' 6"  
Workplace: Quick n' Clean Laundromat
Vehicle: [1996 Lada Samara](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9f/Lada-Samara-2108-side.jpg)

Akeem is a hateful man, and considers the world to have a personal vendetta against him. His mother died during childbirth, and his father resented him for it. He ran away from home at a young age and went to live with Lewis. Despite becoming close friends, the Longs kicked him out after a series of battery charges in small-time gang related violence. Irregardless of this, he is extremely protective of Lewis, and considers Lewis to be his only friend. 

He hates the establishment and dreams of watching the world burn, something he considers justice, and simultaneously reap the the spoils of war as repayment.


## Locations

Mr Azad is a hard-ass and only comes into the laundromat to yell at his employees.


## Battle Rapping

A battle mage's power comes from others' belief in him. The larger the audience of a battle, the more power is available. Furthermore, the spectacle is most of the magic, and those with a larger-than-life persona are better able to suspend the audience's disbelief. To this end, a mask is a powerful artifact, and the more BA the more powerful it is.

The technique was invented by some blatant Tupac rip-off who was rumored to be the greatest battle rapper of all time.

He delved so deeply into the black arts that he ended up driving himself mad, but religiously kept a journal of his findings. This tome contains particularly complex rhyme schemes which seem to be able to manipulate reality itself by reverberating at such a frequency that causality weakens.

The book is rumored to exist, but nobody will admit to having ever seen it.  Tupac has hidden it in an abandoned building in which he used to be a hooligan. It was his hang-out spot, and where he learned to rap with his hoodlum friends.

Biggie and Tupac learned to rap together. Biggie never studied the dark arts, but absorbed some by sheer osmosis of rapping against Tupac.


## Plot

Desmond lives at Kenny's, and is like a brother (jho and jeremy). They have been graduated from highschool for about a year,
and are working at a carwash while they wait for their chance to make it big. Mrs. Dumille isn't a fan of this, and wants them to
get real jobs.

They spend the time at the carwash freestyling and trying out new techniques. This alienates the other workers, but they don't seem
to mind. One day they meet a girl who works at a radio station, who promises she can get them air time. They do, and it goes terribly.

Devastated, they realize they need to step up their game, and rob the best contemporary MC, and their personal hero.

The duo finds a small, leather bound book with a lapis in the cover.

It's a dark book of rhymes, created by lucifer, and passed down
through some of the greatest poets (Aesop, Homer, Shakespeare, do some research) through time at a terrible cost. Kenny's
technique is already so advanced, that the book grabs a hold of him, and he becomes a dark lord of rhyme.

Kenny starts rapping with such avail that he gains supernatural powers. He learns power words, and becomes a powerful wizard. He
gives up everything he used to care about, and Desmond becomes worried. Kenny wants to go solo, because Desmond is dragging
him down, and those with power don't like to share it.

Desmond tracks down a mysterious hermit who is rumored to be capable of amazing things. He finds a whitened famous old skool
rapper, who has done terrible things and as a result striked everything from his mind. If Desmond can restore his memory, OG Loc
will teach him how to become a rap battle wizard. NOW is when Kenny finds and steals the book. He is unwilling to take the long
and hard route to success, opting instead for a get famous quick scheme.

Loc mentions three power artifacts which can help with the transforation - a mask, *other things* - which when combined create a rhyme artifact capable of great rap amplification. Desmond tracks them down, while learning small power words along the way -
rhymes which are hard to craft but can influence the universe to do what he wants.

Kenny has developed a cult, and is starting to take over the world by getting everyone listening to his music. Everyone realizes this
is an issue, but doesn't really say why (because we don't have a good answer).

Loc says the only way to dethrone Kenny is to challenge him to a rap battle, and to win, after which the spell will be broken and the
book destroyed. This is the only way to get his friend back, so Desmond agrees.

Epic rap battle ensues. Desmond loses his idol, and needs to rebuild one during the battle (a la the ultimate insult). Fin.
