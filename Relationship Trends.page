## Foreward

They say that knowledge is power, but ignorance bliss. The following essay is deeply personal, and you will likely learn some things about me which will indubitably ruin my suavity. Nevertheless, these are issues I have known about for a long time. It is my intention that getting them out into the wild will force me to confront these problems as such. If you like my winning attitude and the cut of my jib, and furthermore would like to continue to do so, I would suggest you stop reading here. For those of you interested at a look into the psyche, let's proceed.

## A History of Low Resistence and Poor Choices

I have a history of making poor choices in the department of romantic relationships. Too easily am I roped into liasons I know are bad ideas, be it from clashing personalities, unreciprocated expectations, or simply lack of true interest. I regularly confuse platonic with physical attraction, and am very often unable to determine which I'm actually feeling. This is a problem.

## A Historical Type

When it comes to women, I invariably have a type. External sources say I have a physical type [^1], and while I don't notice nor consider this, arguably they have a point. Nevertheless, I have noticed a personality type, and it goes like this:
- Religious upbringing
- Shy
- Naieve
- Easily pushed around
- Possessing emotional baggage
- Lack of common interests

It's easily argued that there is significant correlation between many of these points, any my introspection suspects that their being shy and having emotional baggage are the significant factors in the list. It's kind of like an ego trip - I'm an extraverted and confident kind of fellow, and cracking a shy egg is a lot of fun. Being one of the few people she will open up to (no pun intended) is a a wonderful feeling. Furthermore, doing so immediately makes one an important force in another's life. If none existed before, a one-way attraction is formed. I will talk more about emotional baggage later.

An interesting phenomenon of life is that you are more likely to like people who like youg ^[citation needed]^ ^[ugly sentence]^. Having created an interest link from a girlfriend to me, the odds are now good that I will feel something in return (this is also the case when I haven't initiated anything). Should this happen, we have created a feedback loop - an effective death spiral of attraction. And that's when things get hairy.
