# The Serenade Project

Serenade intends to be a long-running collection of Sandy Maguire's essays in various stages of completion. The goal is to provide an infrastructure for big ideas which is more stable than the traditional blog format. Serenade is backed by a source control system (git), which as a second purpose serves to document not only the current state of ideas, but also the breadcrumbs that lead to such. [Learn More](Serenade).

There is currently very little content in Serenade (the project is still very young), but [this page](Idea Jotpad) lists the topics about which I am currently planning to write.
