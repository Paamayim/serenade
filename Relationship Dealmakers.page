I once read that instead of making a list of relationship dealbreakers, a more productive index is instead a list of relationship *dealmakers* - ie. traits without which you can't imagine a relationship working. A compatable partner should:

- Regularly challenge me to be better.
- Always be teaching me something new.
- Share a love of music. *Ideally play an instrument.*
- Not let religion cloud real-life issues.
- Be a person independent of the relationship.
- Entice me to listen carefully to every word she[^1] says.
- Be comfortable enough in the relationship that we can do science.
- Have a sense of adventure.
- Want to be with me, rather than be seen with me.
- Possess an unusual skill.
- Be capable of thinking for herself[^1].
- Have a personal integrity.

[^1]: Note: While genders here are feminine, this is not necessarily necessary. While I am not sexually attracted to men, I am completely open to being emotionally attracted to them.
