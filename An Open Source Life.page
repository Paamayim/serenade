> As I grew up, my silly, naive and idealistic capitalist side waned and I settled down into the comfort of being a rabid old Commie. I gave my software away for free. I gave my music away for free ... People posted on the Internet, oh yeah, use this stuff, it's quite good. People I spoke to at computer festivals and other such geekery pissups said 'Oh you're the guy that wrote $thing? Cool, I use that' and bought me beer. Long story short, fuck capitalism. Give the stuff you love away for free, and earn money from the stuff you don't care about. <cite>Gordonjcp, Slashdot comment</cite>

>  I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody. So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always. Everybody canâ€™t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them. <cite>Childish Gambino, That Power</cite>
