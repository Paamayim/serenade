My EPIQ Piracetam arrived in the mail yesterday. I'm excited to try it

### Dosage
- 4 capsules at 8:10am
- another 4 at 12:15pm
- two at 10:30pm

### Effects
Throughout the day, no extremely noticable effects. I was less attentive than usual during the morning meeting. I found myself tuning out as other people spoke, but strangely still interpretting what they were saying. In most cases when I am spaced, the auditory input isn't recognized.

Productivity was lessened also, although this might have been circumstantial and due to a lack of interesting projects (my big longterm project having been wrapped up on Friday). 

My inner monologue was oddly quiet - perhaps this is what people refer to as their mental fog lessening. It was a strange addition, and I'm not sure it was positive. My inner monologue is responsible for a lot of my out-of-band problem solving, and this might be why productivity was lowered. If I'm not working subconsciously on other problems, by the time I get to them I will need to spend more time analyzing them.

I seemed less emotional than usual (although this is not saying much). I was emotionally removed from my noob-filled game of Left4Ddead, and was less annoyed by everyday workplace disturbances and stresses.

My lumosity scores were approximately average, although the memory scores were dismally low. I found more ability to remember harder patterns, but the ones at lower levels were troubling me. Perhaps I wasn't in the zone, but this doesn't really explain the ability to solve the harder difficulty more easily. However, my BPI increased significantly as I played a lot of extra-cirricular games for the first time.

In the evening, after the third dose, I wrote a letter to my grandmother. While I have been writing a lot recently, this letter really stood out. I would describe it as uncharacteristically well-written. The imagery was focused, and small jokes punctuated rhymically throughout the prose, much like the act of a standup commedian. The sentence structure seemed significantly more poetic and well thought-out. A favorite line of mine is: "Hubris is not without a sense of irony, it would seem." Such a sentence is *definitely* atypical of my style.

Dosing so late it is my intention to experience lucid dreams. I will comment on the experience tomorrow.

### Follow-up

No lucid dreams were experienced, but my dreams were indeed more vivid last night. I awoke in a state of emotional distress due to the verisimilitude of one, and was noticably upset for about half an hour.

### Dosage
- 4 capsules at 8:30am
- 4 at 12:15pm

### Effects

The tuning out I had noticed yesterday was still present, but I was more attentive during today's session. Somehow it seems like awareness can wave in and out, with no distinct lines between paying attention and not. My initial reaction is that the filtered out information was recorded more than usual, and that if I were to try I would be able to access it more easily than simple unattention.

Work was significantly more productive today. I found fewer qualms in asking for help, and as a result got things done more quickly than I would have otherwise. I learned that I have vacation time needing to be spent, and surprisingly didn't feel a sense of disloyalty in asking to take them. As a general rule of thumb, I hate taking time off when it is scheduled - I even put off important appointments if I have work or school that day.

I was less anxious about meeting someone new today.

Today's lumosity scores were all high scores, with personal bests in the memory and [some other game I can't remember right now - I will update this tomorrow][]. My BPI is at an all-time high.

My coworkers observed that I seemed more aggressive than usual in my daily game of Left4Dead. This was an observation I also found to be true after having it pointed out to me, although it geniunely seemed as if people were significantly worse than usual today. I'm not sure if this is the case, if I am simply being less tolerant, or if my skills are augmented and I am unaware of this fact. 

This aggression worries me.

I found myself with significantly more energy than usual after work, so much so that I was doing hand stands and head spins.
