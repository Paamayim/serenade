My EPIQ Piracetam arrived in the mail yesterday. I'm excited to try it

### Dosage
- 4 capsules at 8:10am
- another 4 at 12:15pm
- two at 10:30pm

### Effects
Throughout the day, no extremely noticable effects. I was less attentive than usual during the morning meeting. I found myself tuning out as other people spoke, but strangely still interpretting what they were saying. In most cases when I am spaced, the auditory input isn't recognized.

Productivity was lessened also, although this might have been circumstantial and due to a lack of interesting projects (my big longterm project having been wrapped up on Friday). 

My inner monologue was oddly quiet - perhaps this is what people refer to as their mental fog lessening. It was a strange addition, and I'm not sure it was positive. My inner monologue is responsible for a lot of my out-of-band problem solving, and this might be why productivity was lowered. If I'm not working subconsciously on other problems, by the time I get to them I will need to spend more time analyzing them.

I seemed less emotional than usual (although this is not saying much). I was emotionally removed from my noob-filled game of Left4Ddead, and was less annoyed by everyday workplace disturbances and stresses.

My lumosity scores were approximately average, although the memory scores were dismally low. I found more ability to remember harder patterns, but the ones at lower levels were troubling me. Perhaps I wasn't in the zone, but this doesn't really explain the ability to solve the harder difficulty more easily. However, my BPI increased significantly as I played a lot of extra-cirricular games for the first time.

In the evening, after the third dose, I wrote a letter to my grandmother. While I have been writing a lot recently, this letter really stood out. I would describe it as uncharacteristically well-written. The imagery was focused, and small jokes punctuated rhymically throughout the prose, much like the act of a standup commedian. The sentence structure seemed significantly more poetic and well thought-out. A favorite line of mine is: "Hubris is not without a sense of irony, it would seem." Such a sentence is *definitely* atypical of my style.

Dosing so late it is my intention to experience lucid dreams. I will comment on the experience tomorrow.
